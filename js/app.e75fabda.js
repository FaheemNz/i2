Likewise, a site labeled “science”, such as <u>sciencediscoveries.com</u> may have no scientific credibility at all.</p>\n    "},Marriage:{Polygamy:{title:"Multiple Marriages",subtitle1:"Who is Objecting?",content1:"\n  <p>Islam did not introduce polygamy; it simply placed limits on it. Many societies before Islam allowed men to have as many wives as they wished. Islam came and set clear rules , allowing up to four wives, but only if a man can deal with them fairly and take full financial and moral responsibility.</p>\n\n  <blockquote>\n    Marry those that please you of other women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then marry only one.\n    <cite>- Quran 4:3</cite>\n  </blockquote>\n\n  <p>Who usually objects to polygamy? An atheist, a liberal, or a Christian? From an atheist point of view, there is no absolute right or wrong to begin with, so calling polygamy immoral makes no sense. Liberal thinking speaks about freedom and consent, yet most liberal governments ban polygamy even when all adults agree. As for Christianity and Judaism, almost every prophet, from Abraham to David to Solomon, had more than one wife. If someone criticizes Islam for this, they are also criticizing their own scriptures.</p>\n\n  <p>Some people ask, “If men can marry four women, why can’t a woman marry four men?” The answer is simple. If one woman had several husbands, no one could be sure who the father of a child is, which would cause social and family problems. It would also increase the number of women left without partners, since women already outnumber men in most societies.</p>\n\n  <p>Even modern studies note that polygyny is found in nature as a way to keep strong generations. For example, the strongest male lion leads and mates with the lionesses to ensure healthy offspring. But Islam’s version of polygyny is not based on desire or dominance, it is bound by justice, care, and responsibility.</p>\n\n  <p>Western societies made laws to ban polygamy, mostly written by men who wanted freedom without responsibility. By keeping it illegal, they can have many relationships without being held accountable. If polygamy were legal, they would have to provide for those women and their children, which they prefer to avoid.</p>\n\n  <p>Surveys in the United States show that the average man has several relationships before or outside marriage. When a woman becomes pregnant, he often walks away, leaving her to face everything alone. Islam forbids this injustice and demands men take full responsibility for every woman they marry.</p>\n\n  <p>In most countries, there are more women than men because of wars, violence, and men dying earlier. Add to that the rise in same-sex relations and late marriages, and you have many women left without partners. When society ignores this reality, corruption spreads in different forms, from broken families to the sex trade.</p>\n\n  <p>After World War II, Germany faced a severe shortage of men. Some suggested allowing polygamy, but the Church refused. As a result, prostitution became legal and even treated like normal work. Since then, marriage rates have dropped, and many people now see marriage as unnecessary.</p>\n\n  <p>The West does have polygamy; they just call it having girlfriends. The difference is that in Islam, every relationship is legal, public, and carries full responsibility. The modern man wants pleasure without duty. Islam says: if you want more than one, then be fair and responsible and if you can’t, then marry only one.</p>\n",subtitle2:"Conclusion",content2:"\n      <p>If God is Wise and Just, why permit something that may emotionally hurt some women? Because Divine Law looks at society as a whole. If a ruling benefits the majority and prevents widespread corruption, its value is greater than isolated discomfort.</p>\n\n      <p>Islamic polygamy is not a rule but an exception, permitted only under specific circumstances and even then, strict justice among wives is obligatory. Failure to uphold that justice incurs divine accountability. And of course, Muslims living in non-Muslim lands must honor the laws of those nations.</p>\n    "},Arranged:{title:"Arranged Marriages",content:"\n      <p>Forced marriage has nothing to do with Islam! It is a cultural problem, not a religious one. Islam makes it clear that no one can be married without consent. In fact, the Qur’an mentions an example where a woman chose her own husband (Qur’an 28:23–28).</p>\n\n      <p>The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said:</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        A woman without a husband (whether divorced or widowed) must not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin must not be married until her permission is sought. They asked the Prophet: “How is her permission given?” He replied: “Her silence is her consent.”\n        <cite>- Sahih Muslim, Book of Marriage, Hadith 3303</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <p>On another occasion, a woman came to the Prophet (peace be upon him) saying her father had married her off without her approval. He offered to annul the marriage, but she refused, explaining that she only wanted to confirm her right to choose. This shows that Islam not only recognizes a woman’s right to decide, but actively defends it.</p>\n\n      <p>The Qur’an also forbids marrying women by force:</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take back what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them, perhaps you dislike a thing in which Allah has placed much good.\n        <cite>- Qur’an 4:19</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <p>At the same time, Islam does not promote total independence in marriage where parents have no say at all. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said:</p>\n      <blockquote>\n        The marriage of any woman who marries herself without her guardian’s consent is invalid.\n        <cite>- Book 9, Hadith 1879</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <p>This shows that Islam seeks balance. Parents have their role, and so do the children. The guardian’s approval ensures that the marriage is done with wisdom and care, but it must never become control or oppression. If a guardian rejects a suitable proposal for unfair reasons such as race, tribe, or status, the woman can appeal to an Islamic judge. If the court finds the father’s refusal unjust, the judge can step in and approve the marriage himself.</p>\n\n      <p>In most Muslim cultures, arranged introductions happen because men and women grow up separately. Families help find a good match, not to force a decision, but to guide and protect. From a Western point of view, it may seem strange, but in essence, it gives both families a role in ensuring that the marriage is built on shared values, not blind attraction.</p>\n\n      <p>Sadly, in some communities, culture has taken over religion. Some parents pressure their children into marrying cousins or use marriage for immigration benefits. These actions have nothing to do with Islam. Many girls in the West have suffered because of such forced marriages, and some even lost their faith after running away from home. This happens when people follow tradition instead of revelation.</p>\n\n      <p>Another question often asked is why Muslim men are allowed to marry non-Muslim women, while Muslim women are not. Islam permits Muslim men to marry only chaste women from among Jews and Christians, known as the People of the Book, because their original scriptures were revealed by God, even if altered later. This permission is limited, conditional, and based on respect for divine revelation, not personal freedom.</p>\n\n      <p>However, many misuse this allowance. It is not permissible for a Muslim man to marry a woman from a nightclub and call it legitimate. The Qur’an requires modesty, chastity, and responsibility not desire or convenience.</p>\n\n      <p>The restriction for Muslim women is there to protect their faith. If a Muslim husband asks his non-Muslim wife not to serve alcohol or bring pork into their home, she can comply without affecting her beliefs. But if the roles were reversed, a Muslim woman might be pressured into actions that go against her religion. Islam prevents this to preserve her dignity and faith.</p>\n\n      <p>In countries where Muslims are a minority, the rule also protects the religion of the children. If a Muslim man marries a non-Muslim woman and dies or divorces her, the children would likely be raised as non-Muslims under her custody. To prevent that, Islam discourages such marriages unless faith can be safeguarded.</p>\n\n      <p>Arranged marriage in Islam is meant to combine family wisdom with personal choice. It gives parents a role in guiding, but never in forcing. It protects women’s rights while maintaining harmony within the family. When practiced as intended, it builds relationships founded on faith, respect, and shared responsibility, not compulsion, emotion, or self-interest.</p>\n      "},Aisha:{title:"Aisha (RA) Marriage to Prophet (PBUH)",key1:"The first question that must be asked is: who is questioning?

To impose modern standards upon ancient societies is intellectually dishonest and historically absurd."},Divorce:{title:"Divorce",key1:"\n      Many people think divorce in Islam is extremely easy, that a man only has to say 'You are divorced' three times and it is done. In reality, divorce in Islam is far from casual. There are strict conditions to ensure fairness, reflection, and protection of women and children. \n      <br><br>\n      Divorce cannot be pronounced during menstruation or immediately after sexual relations. This ensures the decision is not influenced by temporary emotional states. If the man is in extreme anger or mental distress, the pronouncement is invalid, as the Prophet (PBUH) stated: \n      <blockquote>The divorce pronouncement is not valid at the time of mental seizure.</blockquote>\n      <br>\n      After a valid pronouncement, the woman enters a waiting period (iddah) of three menstrual cycles. This confirms she is not pregnant and provides time for reconciliation. If she is pregnant, the iddah lasts until delivery, prioritizing the welfare of the child.\n      ",subtitle1:"Saying Divorce 3 times",key2:"\n      Divorce is strongly discouraged in Islam. Couples facing conflict must appoint arbitrators for reconciliation. As the Quran states: \n      <blockquote>And if you fear dissension between the two, send an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people. If they both desire reconciliation, Allah will cause it between them. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Acquainted with all things. <cite> - Quran 4:35</cite></blockquote>\n      <br>\n      Regarding saying the word <i>divorce</i> three times, authentic hadith clarify: \n      <blockquote>Abu al-Sahba' said to Ibn 'Abbas: Enlighten us about whether the three divorces were treated as one during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger and Abu Bakr. He said: It was in fact so, but during the caliphate of 'Umar (RA), when people began to pronounce divorce frequently, he allowed them to do so. <cite>- Sahih Muslim, 9:3493</cite></blockquote>\n    ",subtitle2:"Divorce is primarily the husband's right?",key3:"\n      Muslim women are often portrayed as being oppressed due to their being denied the right to divorce.\n        <br><br>\n      The pronouncement of divorce (talaaq) is primarily the right of the husband as he is in the position of authority in the family. Also, PMS considerations and the emotional nature of women could cause a greater incidence of divorce if it were put the hands of the wives as an automatic right.\n      <br/><br />\n      The wife may institute divorce proceedings by making her request through the court. If the judge (Qaadee) sees just cause or a real need on her part, he can act on her behalf and institute the khula' divorce which has a waiting period of only one menstrual cycle. A woman can obtain the right to pronounce divorce if it is made a condition in her marriage contract which her husband agrees to. She may also gain the right by requesting her husband’s permission at any point during the marriage. If permission is given she may pronounce divorce according to the previously mentioned conditions.\n    "},MenMoreImportant:{subtitle1:"Are Men More Important Than Women",key1:"\n      Many modern arguments begin with the assumption that men and women must be identical in every social, political and economic sphere. Islam approaches the matter differently. It gives both genders equal spiritual worth while distributing responsibilities in a way that reflects their natural strengths, the structure of the family and the preservation of harmony.\n\n      <br /><br />\n\n      Consider the status of mothers. \n\n      <blockquote>\n      A man came to Prophet (PBUH) and said, O Allah's Messenger (PBUH)! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me? The Prophet (PBUH) said, Your mother. The man said. Who is next? The Prophet(PBUH) said, Your mother. The man further said, Who is next? The Prophet (PBUH) said, Your mother. The man asked for the fourth time, Who is next? The Prophet (PBUH) said, Your father.\n      <cite>- Sahih Bukhari 5970</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      If the mother holds a rank above the father and yet we insist that every aspect of life must be split into equal halves, the scales would tilt completely. In the relationship between husband and wife you would have an even division, while in the relationship between mother and father you would have a seventy-five to twenty five imbalance in favor of the woman. The combined effect would not produce equality but dominance. \n      <br /><br />\n      To preserve balance, Islam assigns certain responsibilities to men within the husband and wife relationship, not as a superior rank but as a stabilizing force that prevents one role from overshadowing the other.\n  ",subtitle2:"Need for a Decision Maker",key2:"\n      A family is not a courtroom nor a parliament. It is a living environment filled with emotions, responsibilities and moments where decisions must be made quickly and decisively. When a husband and wife reach a point where discussion has failed and both refuse to yield, Islam provides a simple mechanism to prevent the relationship from freezing. The husband is tasked with resolving the deadlock, provided he does not violate the woman's rights or impose anything that contradicts the faith.\n\n      This rule does not imply that the husband is always wiser or more capable. It recognizes the reality that a home cannot function without a final point of resolution. \n      \n      <br /><br />\n      \n      Every structured system needs this. Even democratic bodies use the first past the post system or a decisive speaker to prevent endless debate. When a vote is tied, someone must choose, otherwise nothing moves. If societies accept this principle at national levels where billions of lives are affected, it is even more reasonable that a family, the foundation of society itself, has a clear method to end indecision.\n\n      <br /> <br />\n\n      It is also important to understand that the legal distinctions between the roles of men and women do not reflect superiority. Men and women are spiritually equal and morally accountable before the same Lord. The differences exist to preserve stability. The husband’s responsibility to break a deadlock is not a privilege but a burden. He must answer before Allah for every decision he makes, and he is accountable if he abuses this responsibility. The law gives him the final word not to elevate him, but to protect the family from falling into chaos.\n\n      When Islam allows a man to pronounce divorce more easily, it is not because he is more valued but because he is more exposed to external pressures and has a greater obligation to financially maintain the household. Meanwhile the woman, by divine mercy, is protected from sudden emotional decisions. \n      \n      <br /> <br />\n      \n      Each role complements the other and prevents the system from collapsing under human impulses.\n  ",subtitle3:"Who Should Break the Gridlock",key3:"\n      The next question naturally arises. If a deadlock must be broken, why should the man be the one to do it? \n      \n      <br /> <br />\n\n      The answer becomes clear when we look at another profound reality. A mother holds a deep, instinctive influence over her children. Her emotional connection often shapes their loyalties and feelings in a way that cannot be legislated or restricted. Without a balancing force, this influence could unintentionally overpower the role of the father.\n\n      To ensure that neither parent dominates the household through a power imbalance, the law gives the husband the responsibility of resolving a stalemate. This creates a natural check that counters the emotional authority the mother holds in the hearts of her children. It becomes a balance similar to constitutional checks and balances, where each branch of government restrains the other so that power does not gather in one place.\n\n      <br /><br />\n\n      If these checks are removed from a family structure, the consequences become visible. The last sixty years show a consistent rise in divorce rates across the world. Many marriages collapse not because of grave wrongdoing but because disagreements reach a point where no resolution is possible. There is no final decision maker and no mechanism to end the conflict, so the marriage breaks under the pressure.\n\n      <br /> <br />\n\n      Islam steps in with a simple, humane principle. Allow the man to end the deadlock with full responsibility on his shoulders, while allowing the children their natural affinity toward their mother. The result is a form of equality that is not artificial or mathematical. It is lived equality. It is an equilibrium created by acknowledging emotional realities, psychological patterns and the delicate architecture of the family. It is not superiority. It is balance. It is the wisdom of a system that sees human beings as they truly are and organizes their relationships in a way that preserves justice, stability and mercy.\n  "},Inheritence:{title:"Inheritance Objections",key1:"The unequal division of inheritance between men and woman is sometimes cited as an example of Islam's oppression of women.",key2:"Before looking at the division of inheritance in Islam with regard to women, one needs to look at Western inheritance laws. The right for women to inherit and own property was only given to women in the West at the turn of the century, whereas that right was given to women in Islaam 1,400 years ago.",key3:"Furthermore, in the West, a person may legally write a will giving all of their wealth to their dog or cat and exclude their wife, children, and other relatives. In the Islamic system, the rights of wives, children and relatives to inherit are protected. Set portions of the inheritance to be given to them are identified in the Quran.",key4:"No one can write a will and cancel or modify what is due to them. A will can be written to give up to a maximum of one third to those who would not inherit by law. As to leaving even the third of one’s wealth to animals, the Muslim State could step in on behalf of the inheritors and cancel such a will as it obviously indicates some form of mental disorder. The third would then be divided up among the natural inheritors.",key5:"In an Islamic society men are responsible for the maintenance of women. For example, if a son, a daughter and a mother inherit, the son also has the additional responsibility of looking after his sister and his mother. Consequently, based on the male role, Islamic Law awards the son twice the portion of the daughter.",key6:"However, the two to one division is not applied in all cases. For example, the Quran states (4: 11): “If a man or woman [died and] left neither descendants for ascendants, but left behind a brother or a sister, each gets 1/6th; and if they are more than two, they equally share 1/3rd.",key7:"So it is not black and white & different things should be treated differently on account of their difference."},WomenWitness:{title:"Two Women Equal to One Man",key1:"\n      Critics often point to the Islamic rule regarding witnesses and claim that Islam considers women inferior because a single male witness is equivalent to two female witnesses. The matter, however, is far more nuanced when understood in its proper legal and historical context.\n  ",key2:"\n      The Quran does indeed state in Al-Baqarah 2:282: Get two of your men as witnesses. But if two men are not available, then get a man and two women agreeable to you as witnesses, so that if one of them makes a mistake, the other can remind her. It is essential to note that the verse begins with the instruction concerning business contracts. The requirement is not universal. It is specific to commercial dealings where precision and familiarity with technical detail are crucial.\n  ",key3:"\n      In societies where women did not usually engage in large scale financial transactions, this consideration was natural. Western societies often view this verse through the lens of the twentieth century, when women entered the workforce in significant numbers. Their entry was driven by necessity during the World Wars when millions of men were sent to the front lines and industries needed workers. After the wars ended many women refused to return to traditional domestic roles and the modern feminist movement grew from that cultural shift.\n  ",key4:"\n      As time passed, fulfilment became associated with professional life rather than the home. Even women who held positions with limited authority sometimes preferred the workplace to domestic duties. This made the earlier Quranic consideration seem irrelevant to them. Yet the reality remains that even in America a large portion of women continue to spend most of their lives within their homes while their husbands work outside. In many parts of the world this pattern is even more pronounced. Thus the Quranic rule reflects lived reality rather than imagined ideals.\n  ",key5:"\n      At the same time Islam does not treat all forms of testimony the same. In matters that fall within the natural sphere of women, the witness of one woman is fully sufficient. Moreover the role of a witness is not the same as the role of a narrator. A narrator of Hadith transmits the deen itself. There is no disparity between men and women in this context. Some of the greatest narrators in Islamic history were women such as Aisha RA. Her authority stands alongside the greatest male scholars with complete parity. This narration of revelation is more critical than any legal testimony concerning worldly contracts.\n  ",key6:"\n      When the law discusses witnesses it is not only speaking about rights but responsibilities. Why is it that the discussion always focuses on fewer rights and never on fewer responsibilities. Classically the witness who is proven to have given false testimony is subjected to punishment even to the extent of lashes. If one of four witnesses in a case is discovered to have lied all four are punished. If the law had made men and women identical in this burden, people would object that an innocent woman was being lashed for something she did not do. The difference therefore protects her from the harsh repercussions attached to legal witnessing.\n  ",key7:"\n      When viewed through the lens of punitive accountability this distinction is not a demotion. It is in fact a mercy. Allah does not place a woman in a position where she is exposed to greater physical hardship, especially within the framework of an Islamic state where the law must be applied with justice and consistency. The rule does not diminish her dignity or her intellect. It recognizes her wider responsibilities, her often more delicate physical nature and the compassion that the law intends to preserve. Islamic testimony is not about superiority but about the protection of individuals and the stability of society. When seen with clarity the rule reflects not inferiority but divine gentleness.\n  "}},Violence:{Jihad:{title:"Jihad",key1:"Usually translated by the Western media as “holy war” is a greatly misunderstood principle in Islaam.

Kings, for example, speak with the plural - actually not only Kings but presidents, today, speak with the plural i.e we have won the election, etc. Same is the case with Torah albeit Jews don\'t believe in trinity but one God.</p>\n\n      <p>\n        As a sidenote, Arabic is a different language compared to English! People think there are problems with the language of the Quran when in fact, the problem is with the language itself! Just to give an example - in English, there is one plural i.e the plural of the word disbeliever would be disbelievers but in Arabic, the plural(s) of the word \'الكافر\' (disbeliever) would be \'الكفار\' (disbelievers) and \'كافرون\' (disbelievers).\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Anyway, in the Quran you will find different kind of pronouns used for Allah & to understand this, you will have to understand what are the different kinds of pronouns:\n        <ol>\n          <li>3rd person - He, she, and they</li>\n          <li>2nd person - You</li>\n          <li>1st person - I and We</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        In the Arabic language, there are 6 kinds of you. When in the 3rd person, Allah uses "he", in the 2nd person Allah uses "you" (singular), Allah doesn\'t use "they"! He uses singular 3rd person, singular 2nd person, and the only time he uses the plural is in 1st person! If it was literally a plural, you should have found it in the 1st person, 2nd person, and the 3rd person.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Now, when Allah is being formal or if Allah is distancing himself from a group of people, you will find the word "he" in the Quran - why, because the 3rd person is the most distant pronoun. Whenever a servant talks to Allah, he uses the word "you" not "he", in the Quran. And, what is left is I and We - <strong>Allah uses the word "I" in extreme love or extreme anger</strong> (please verify this yourself) & <strong>the word "We" in the role of a majesty</strong>.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        For example, in the following verse, he uses the word "We" not "I" (expressing majesty): \n        \n        <blockquote>Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur\'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\n        <cite>- Quran 15:9</cite></blockquote>\n        <blockquote>We have decreed death among you, and We are not to be outdone.

And you have already known the first creation, so will you not remember?\n        <cite>- Quran 56:60-62</cite></blockquote>\n\n        But in the following verse, he doesn\'t use the word "We" but "I" (expressing anger):\n        <blockquote>And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.\n        <cite>- Quran 2:41</cite></blockquote>\n        <blockquote>Then I swear by the setting of the stars, And indeed, it is an oath - if you could know - [most] great.

The question is that in the Quran, you find that Allah uses the word "he" for himself. The word "he" is obviously male, so how can we use the male word for God even though Allah is beyond gender?</p>\n\n        <p>\n          As mentioned earlier, the Arabic language works differently than the English language. In the English language, you have 3 options - you can use "he" or "she" or "it". "He" is a male connotation, "she" is a female connotation and "it" is beyond gender. So you would have the choice of "it" but the problem is the word "it" is for inanimate objects, so "it" would be inappropriate for Allah because it necessitates the assumption that it\'s a non-living thing.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          None of the aforementioned 3 options can truly do justice for Allah. In the Arabic language, there is no "it", there is just "he" and "she". Grammatically speaking, the word "he" in the Arabic language serves 2 functions i.e male and masculine & actually <strong>before it even serves the function of male, its primary purpose is to communicate the masculine</strong>.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          In the Arabic language, the word "he" can be used for things that have gender and things that don\'t have gender & it is more about grammar than biology. E.g sun in Arabic is feminine! Is sun biologically female? Masculine and feminine are different from males and females.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The question assumes because the English language uses the word "he" for "males", the Arabic equivalent must also be used for males. This is where understanding Arabic linguistics and the overall structure of the Arabic language helps. As an overview, Arabic language as a construct has certain principles that dictate how the whole language is organized and one of those guiding principles is that the masculine is the default - a word will remain masculine until there is a reason to consider it feminine, you don\'t get out of the masculine gender unless you have some grammatical reason.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The fact that "he" is used for Allah actually indicates that this is the default, it is how it is supposed to be. The problem doesn\'t exist at all in Arabic but in English - that is the reason no one since the inception of the Quran, actually attributed masculinity to Allah - even among the Pagan Arabs. In English, we have to use the word "he" as we don\'t have a better word. If there was a word in English called "Hie" & the English Grammar rule was to use "Hie" with things that don\'t have gender & are living, no one would have thought about the question being discussed. One might say, the word "Hie" doesn\'t make any sense - to which the reply would be, how does "He" or "She" or "it" make any sense?   \n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          We take language for granted! Let\'s develop a new language right now & name it <strong>Enblish</strong>: The word for he in Enblish is "ζב", the word for she in Enblish is "בζ" and the word for majesty and power in Enblish is "ζφά". Problem solved! Now when translating from Arabic to Enblish, the word "ζφά" will be used and no one will ever object as it literally means majesty & royalty! \n        </p>\n\n        <p>This might sound funny but this is how languages are developed!

These judgments depend on perspective, not on absolute truth.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Even suffering itself is not absolute. Short term pain can lead to long term benefit.

Likewise, a clumsy person must be kept away from the seashore, not the proficient swimmer; and a child must be prevented from handling a snake, not the skilled snake charmer.</blockquote>\n      </p>\n      "},Predestination:{title:"Predestination & Free will",key1:"\n      <p>\n      Many of the puzzles surrounding predestination arise from treating God as if He is bound by the human experience of time. Just as we instinctively understand that God is not confined by space, we should not imagine that He is confined by past, present and future. No believer would claim that God literally walks in a garden or travels from one point in space to another. In the same way, it is equally mistaken to imagine that His being is stretched along a timeline in the way ours is.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Even the staunchest atheist, in arguing against belief, never suggests that God is sitting on a bus from one city to the next, because even he understands that such a description contradicts what a believer means by God. Yet the same error returns when people insist that God must have a past and a future. To place God inside time is to make Him a creature of the very thing He created.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      We do not struggle to accept that God can know what is happening in two different places at the same moment, because we understand His transcendence of space. Time, however, is harder for us to grasp because unlike space, we cannot move within it. We cannot step into yesterday or walk into tomorrow. We are locked in one moment while time flows around us. For this reason, we find it difficult to comprehend that God is independent of time entirely.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      An hour from now, we will be in that hour, and there is no path around it. God does not operate within this limitation. He created time and is not contained by any of its dimensions. His knowledge encompasses every event, regardless of its distance in time, just as His knowledge encompasses every point in space, regardless of location.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The Qur’an also teaches that our experience of time is not absolute. On the Day of Judgment, human beings will realise how their perceptions of time were nothing more than fleeting shadows.\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>It will be, on the Day they see it, as though they had not remained except for an afternoon or a morning thereof. <cite>- Quran 79:46</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>And on the Day when He will gather them, as if they had not remained but an hour of the day, and they will know each other. <cite>- Quran 10:45</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>They will murmur among themselves, You remained not but ten days. We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them will say, You remained not but one day. <cite>- Quran 20:103-104</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>He will say, How long did you remain on earth in a number of years? They will say, We remained a day or part of a day; ask those who enumerate. He will say, You stayed not but a little if only you had known. <cite>- Quran 23:112-114</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>\n      Translators often render these verses in the future tense because from our current perspective these events have not yet unfolded. But the Qur’an frequently speaks of the Day of Judgment in the present or even past tense. This is not merely a stylistic device; it highlights that the next life is a different order of existence, one in which the rules of time as we know them no longer apply. What is future to us is not necessarily future to God.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      When someone asks, What is the benefit of prayer if God has already predetermined everything, the question assumes that God is standing inside time looking forward into a future that is already fixed. But to imagine God this way is to imagine a being who is finite. A future can only exist for someone who is bound by time. This is why the question becomes contradictory. It assumes that God is both beyond time and inside time simultaneously.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      A question based on contradictory premises will always create contradictory answers. If one insists that a circle is also a square, then one will be trapped between yes and no when asked whether a circle has corners. The contradiction lies in the premise, not in the answer. In the same way, before asking about predestination, one must ask whether the question rests on an assumption that cannot be true.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Even the word predestination causes confusion. If by it we mean that God once wrote the future in the past, the assumption is that He lives within past and future. But if predestination means that God’s knowledge, power and wisdom encompass all things and that nothing escapes His will, that meaning is correct and does not conflict with prayer. It simply affirms that nothing in creation can overpower His authority.\n      </p>\n  ",subtitle1:"If Allah knows everything then where is the test?",key2:"\n      <p>\n      The first question that must be asked is: what are the attributes Allah cannot abandon without ceasing to be Allah? He is All Knowing, All Powerful and Wise. If He ceased to be any of these, He would no longer be God. With that in mind, the question becomes: can Allah create a world in which we act by our free will while His knowledge and will still encompass everything? \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The only reason a person might say no is because he imagines a scenario that forces God to give up one of His attributes. But Allah is capable of establishing a reality that preserves His perfection while granting us genuine choice. The details of how this balance operates are beyond our comprehension. There are two tests: one written by Allah and one written by us, perfectly corresponding from start to finish even though only Allah sees how. How this harmony is achieved is part of the unseen.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Many insist that since Allah knows the outcome, our actions are not real choices. But this only returns to the same assumption over and over again. They accept that Allah is All Knowing yet treat His All Powerful attribute as if it does not exist. If Allah can create an entire universe from nothing, He can also create a reality where His knowledge and our free will do not contradict each other. The contradiction exists only when human imagination places limits on Him.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The Qur’an corrects these assumptions directly:\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>Say, Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying. <strong>Say, With Allah is the biggest argument. Had He willed, He would have guided you all.</strong> <cite>- Quran 6:148-149</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression. And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie. <cite>- Quran 72:4-5</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>\n      Today people discuss metaphysics as if they have mastered every other field. Yet the simplest questions about our own existence remain unanswered. Something within us says I but which part of the body is it? It is not the eyes, the hands, the face, the heart or even the brain, because these continue functioning for a short while after death. Even if the entire human race gathered together, they could not explain the essence of the soul, or the nature of consciousness. How then can such a limited being hope to grasp how divine knowledge and human choice intertwine?\n      </p>\n  "},EternalHellfire:{title:"Hellfire",key1:'\n      <p>\n      The common objection is: why would Allah create a human being whom He already knows will end up in Hell? Why not simply create only those who will enter Paradise, give them free will, and judge them accordingly? But this objection collapses immediately. If one argues that Allah should not create a person destined for Hell, then by the same logic, why create a person destined for Paradise after giving him free will? Why not place him in Paradise from the very beginning? Adam (PBUH) himself began in Paradise so why remove him only to send him back again? These questions reveal the limits of human reasoning, not a flaw in divine wisdom.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The real question becomes: why create humans at all? And the answer is already given by Allah:\n      <blockquote>And mention, when your Lord said to the angels, Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority. They said, Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You? Allah said, Indeed, I know that which you do not know. <cite>- Quran 2:30</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <i>I know what you do not know</i>, yet human beings still dispute. These objections arise from approaching the attributes of God through contradictory assumptions and human limitations. The real question behind all such riddles is: can Allah create a scenario where none of this happens? The Qur’an responds directly to such flawed reasoning:\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>\n      Those who associated with Allah will say, "If Allah had willed, we would not have associated [anything] and neither would our fathers nor would we have prohibited anything." Likewise did those before deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, "Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying." <br />\n      <strong>Say, "With Allah is the biggest argument. Had He willed, He would have guided you all."</strong>\n      <cite>- Quran 6:148-149</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <p>\n      If humans were placed directly into Hell, they would immediately claim that Allah never gave them a fair chance, that no guidance reached them, that no test was offered. The Qur’an reveals this argument explicitly:\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>\n      And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, "Our Lord, why did You not send to us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced?"\n      <cite>- Quran 20:136</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n      \n      <p>\n      Our minds cannot grasp how divine knowledge and human free will operate together. A robot can never comprehend the thoughts, intentions, or purposes of its programmer. The limitations of its design prevent it from looking beyond its framework. For the developer, however, the entire system is simple. The same applies to human beings: finite minds cannot fully comprehend infinite wisdom, even though that wisdom remains perfectly coherent.\n      </p>\n  ',subtitle2:"Eternal Hellfire",key2:'\n      <p>\n      This objection is deeply connected to the previous one. The first principle is simple: we are not authorized to speak about salvation on behalf of Allah. In the Qur’an, Allah speaks as He wills, and no one is allowed to speak in His place. Consider a king addressing his court; if he rebukes “servant x,” and “servant y” repeats the king’s rebuke as if it were his own words, who is out of line? This analogy illustrates that divine speech is not ours to reproduce with our own interpretations.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Allah even says to the Prophet (PBUH):\n      <blockquote>Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like... <cite>- Quran 28:56</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      And the Prophet (PBUH), addressing his own daughter, Fatimah (RA), said:\n      <blockquote>\n      O Fatimah, rescue thyself from the Fire, for I have no power (to protect you) from Allah in anything except this that I would sustain a relationship with you.\n      <cite>- Sahih Muslim (Book 1, Number 0399)</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      This statement was connected to the revelation of:\n      <blockquote>And warn your nearest kindred... <cite>- Quran 26:214</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Every soul will arrive individually on the Day of Judgment. The only criterion for safety is what Allah Himself mentions:\n      <blockquote>\n      "The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail. But only he will prosper that brings to Allah a sound heart."\n      <cite>- Quran 26:88-89</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      How do we recognize a sound heart? We cannot. Only Allah knows. But the Qur’an gives us a crucial truth:\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>What would Allah do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe? <cite>- Quran 4:147</cite></blockquote>\n      <blockquote>And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves. <cite>- Quran 11:101</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>\n      Some worry about Hellfire being eternal, but their concern is built upon assumptions, not knowledge. Allah may do whatever He wills with His creation. If someone insists that eternal Hell is unjust, and his source is the Qur’an, then the same source must also be accepted when it describes Allah as the Most Just and the Most Merciful. Both cannot be selectively used.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The Qur’an shows that the inhabitants of Hell will themselves admit the justice of their fate:\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>\n      They will say, “Our Lord, You gave us death twice and You gave us life twice. Now we confess our sins. So, is there any way to come out of here?” \n      <cite>- Quran 40:11</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>\n      Thus they will confess their sin. So, away with the people of Hell!\n      <cite>- Quran 67:11</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>\n      They will say, "Our Lord, our wretchedness overcame us, and we were a people astray. Our Lord, remove us from it, and if we were to return, we would indeed be wrongdoers." He will say, "Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me..."\n      <cite>- Quran 23:106-110</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>\n      Man will be informed that Day of what he sent ahead and kept back. Rather, man, against himself, will be a witness, even if he presents his excuses.\n      <cite>- Quran 75:13-15</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <p>\n      Even worldly justice demonstrates that the severity of a crime is not measured by the time required to commit it. A murder may take seconds, yet its punishment can be life imprisonment. The analogy collapses when one insists on matching action-time to punishment-time. No justice system on earth functions on that principle.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Regarding the eternity of Hellfire, the deeper question is: what do you mean by eternal? We have no concept of the nature of time in the next life. The Qur’an uses the word <strong>خالدون</strong> and at times adds <strong>الأبد</strong>. These carry similar meanings, yet Allah uses them with precision. In passages where Heaven and Hell are mentioned together, <strong>الأبد</strong> consistently accompanies Heaven but not Hell, as seen in 98:6–98:8 and 64:9–64:10.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Another verse uses a unique expression:\n      <blockquote>In which they will remain for ages [unending]. <cite>- Quran 78:23</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The word <strong>اَحقَابًا</strong> refers to successive periods whose nature is known only to Allah. Ultimately, the matter returns to a principle the Qur’an repeats:\n      <blockquote>\n      He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.\n      <cite>- Quran 21:23</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n      Perhaps Allah intentionally leaves the matter open so that people do not indulge in the unseen. What happens in the next life is entirely under His wisdom and His will.\n      </p>\n  '},Music:{title:"Music in Islam",key1:"\n      <p>The general impression among some ignorant Muslims is that Islaam prohibits music.\n      However, that is not the case.</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          God made human nature such that it loves music, especially in the case of children.\n          Islamic law does not prohibit music but regulates it by banning only its harmful\n          aspects.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          The Prophet (PBUH) prohibited the use of wind and stringed instruments in a well known\n          hadeeth saying: <blockquote>There will be people of my nation who will legalize fornication, the\n          wearing of silk, drinking wine and the use of musical instruments... <cite>- Sahih al-Bukhari 5590 (Book 74, Hadith 16)</cite></blockquote> \n          He also prohibited males from listening to adult female singers saying, “Some people from my\n          nation will drink wine, calling it another name.

Where homosexuality was considered an illness by the Association of Psychiatrists, it is now removed from the list and replaced by homophobia (the dislike of homosexuals and homosexuality).\n        Consequently, Islaam and Muslims are considered intolerant and biased due to their continued opposition. Arguments in favor of tolerance to homosexuals are based on the assumption that homosexual behavior is biologically based and not merely learned from society.\n        </p>\n        \n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Early opposition to homosexuality was based on the argument that such behavior was\n              unnatural. Sodomy cannot produce children which is one of the main natural\n              consequences of sexual relations. “Mother Nature” did not make us that way, it was\n              argued. To counter such arguments homosexual researchers scoured the earth until\n              they found supposed homosexual behavior among the animal kingdom.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n            They found that the males of some species of exotic fishes of the coast of Japan imitated the\n            behavior of females of the species in order to prevent other males from impregnating\n            their mates, and some rare butterflies from islands of the coast of Africa also had\n            males exhibiting female behavior during mating season, etc. However, if the animal\n            kingdom is to be used to justify human behavior, there also exists a spider in South\n            America, whose female is much larger than the male.

However, this\n              evidence, while seeming incontrovertible to the layman, was immediately refuted by\n              scientists. The data was taken from cross-sections of the brains of dead adult humans\n              whose sexual preference was identified prior to death. Consequently, the reduced size\n              among homosexuals could have been a result of the practice and not its cause.

He gave expert testimony to the Colorado\n              Supreme Court that formed the basis of the victorious decision striking down anti-gay\n              Proposition. However, a replication of his study at the University of Western\n              Ontario failed to find any linkage whatsoever between the X chromosome and sexual orientation.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              It was also found that Hamer’s study lacked a control group; a fundamental principle of scientific research. Furthermore, in June 1994, the Chicago Tribune reported that a junior researcher in Hamer’s laboratory who assisted in the gene mapping in the homosexuality study, alleged that he selectively reported his data. She was then summarily dismissed from her post-doctoral fellowship in\n              Hamer’s lab. But a National Institutes of Health investigation substantiated her claims and gave her another position in a different lab.

The early spread of AIDS was concentrated among the\n            homosexual community. It later spread to the heterosexual community through blood\n            transfusions and intravenous drug usage and so-called bisexuals.

It is inconceivable that\n              God made people homosexuals then declared it a crime and prescribed punishments\n              for it in both this life and the next. To accept such a proposition is to accept that God\n              is unjust. Inclinations can exist within humans for a variety of natural and unnatural\n              acts, from fornication to rape and from necrophilia to bestiality. These inclinations\n              may come from jinn-suggestions, media influence, or even from human whisperings\n              or direct contact.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Human beings are not like robots who only do what they are\n              programmed to do.

Currently, some scientists are even\n              claiming that murder is of genetic origin. To accept that would mean to excuse\n              murderers and tolerate murder.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Islaam instructs parents to separate their children in their beds by the age of ten in\n              order to avoid sexual experiences which may result from childhood experimentation.\n              Such experiences may be reinforced by contacts in schools and through abuse from\n              adults. Also the distinctions between males and females are strongly made in Islaamic\n              teachings. The Prophet cursed men who imitated women and women who imitated\n              men.

He used\n        the analogy that if a clock were discovered by someone and asked where it\n        came from, it would be absurd to argue that the clock was found simply\n        because it had existed forever. The clock exists because it has a maker who\n        made it for a distinct purpose. In this case, the clock has several intricate parts\n        that are put together, framed, and adjusted to produce motion, which in\n        turn is regulated to provide relative measure of time. Similarly he claimed\n        that the universe and its many parts, which are far more complex than a clock\n        must have intelligent design and purpose. As a simple example, anyone who\n        has studied the human eye would be foolish to think that it has been created\n        (or “evolved” as some would have it) without purpose or intelligent design.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n        Other kinds of design arguments relate to order, regularity and an\n        underlying unity in nature, have received increasing support in modern\n        scientific fields such as quantum physics, astronomy and biochemistry.

With respect to the formation of the\n        universe, astronomers have estimated that the balance of matter to\n        antimatter had to be accurate to one part in ten billion for the universe to\n        even arise. Had it been larger or greater by one part in ten billion, no universe\n        would have arisen.

In addition, the likelihood of the universe arising by mere\n          chance is essentially zero as indicated by modern calculations discussed\n          earlier.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n          If it is implied that Darwinian evolution or natural selection can be\n          used as an alternative to Divine order, then this too is blatantly false. Other\n          writers, such as <a target="_blank" class="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Behe">M. Behe</a>, <a target="_blank" class="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Dewar">D. Dewar</a> and <a target="_blank" class="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_C._Meyer">Stephen Meyer</a> have offered a\n          thorough discussion of the fallacies in interpreting Darwinian evolution.\n          Suffice it to say, however, that even if one were to accept Darwinian\n          evolution, this does not in any way explain the cause or source of such\n          evolution. Darwin, himself expressed some of his doubts when he wrote a letter that "the belief in natural selection must at present be grounded entirely on general considerations... when we descend to details... we can\'t prove that a single species has changed, nor can we prove that the supposed changes are beneficial, which is the groundwork of the theory. \n          </li>\n          <li>\n          God cannot be caused or designed by another being. If the\n          implication of the original criticism is that multiple gods could also be\n          responsible for design, then there is no logic in such a thought. Multiplicity\n          only applies to finite beings. For example, if the world we occupy is finite\n          in space, multiple worlds can easily be envisioned; but if the world is\n          infinite in space there cannot be but one world. <br />\n          Similarly, there can only be one Infinite, Supreme Being- anything more would contradict the\n          concept of infinity. It is also worthwhile to reference the famous principle\n          known as “Occam\'s Razor’, which has even been defended by Hume\n          himself. This principle, which has been supported by numerous\n          philosophers and scientists, whether theistic or atheistic, states that\n          "entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity". The implication is that\n          if a single, supreme God can be said to be responsible for intelligent design\n          in the universe, then there is no reason to posit multiple gods just for the\n          sake of argument. Still further, there is the problem of potential conflict\n          and division of power among multiple deities that must be dealt with.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n          Even if one were to accept the idea of disorder, one has to explain the\n          order that does exist. Nonetheless, to address the criticism, it should be\n          realized that disorder is also a subjective term that can be misperceived.\n          The modern study of fractals in mathematics is a clear example of order\n          being found where others had only perceived random disorder and ir-\n          regularity. Many patterns in nature, including everything from the branches of a tree, the winding path of a river or coastline, the distribution of galaxy clusters, the branching of blood vessels to even the Brownian motion of molecules and particles have been described by the concept of fractals that are generated by geometric equations that repeat at very small scales to produce amazing shapes and surfaces on a larger scale. Hence, just because Hume or Kant does not perceive order doesn\'t mean order doesn\'t exist.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      '},FirstCause:{title:"The Cosmological First Cause Argument",key1:"\n      <p>\n        One of the earliest thinkers to promote this argument was the famous Greek\n        philosopher, Aristotle (384-322 B.C.).

Others\n        support the argument of emanation. \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Aristotle related God as the “Unmoved\n        Mover” or “Prime Mover” who causes all causes and activity in the universe\n        since everything and every occurrence must be traced back to an original\n        cause or source based on the law of causality. God is the eternal Prime Mover\n        who moves all things while He remains stationary.

However, the Prime Mover or Cause of all causes is different from\n        secondary causes in that it is immaterial and spiritual in nature, and hence, is\n        not subject to the laws governing matter. In addition, the Prime Mover is an\n        agent that must be free to do as He pleases since this is the only way that a\n        temporal universe could arise from an eternal cause. He is also considered\n        infinitely powerful in order to create something out of nothing. Some have\n        also specified that the First Cause must be timeless and unchanging since if\n        there is no actual change, there is no change in time (others do not consider this an essential part of the argument). Time can only pass in connection\n        with movement or change and is also a creation of God.\n      </li>\n\n      <li>\n        David Hume has taken issue with the law of causality saying that the ideas\n        of cause and effect are distinct, and that it is possible for something to arise\n        without a cause.

However, this argument is very weak\n        and has been refuted by a number of philosophers who argue that the mere\n        imagining of a being does not entail existence without cause. Imagining that\n        a chicken came into being without cause does not mean that the chicken can\n        actually exist without cause.

The\n          Kalam argument basically states that our current existence and universe has\n          to be finite and with a beginning because it would be impossible to arrive at\n          the present moment if the past were infinite and uncreated. It argues that it\n          is impossible to cross an actual infinite. Simply stated, no one can ever count\n          to infinity, so we cannot be living in an eternal universe. It should also be\n          remembered that the conditions which apply to the First Cause argument\n          also apply here - namely that the First Cause is immaterial, free, and timeless.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          The crux of the argument hinges on whether or not there can be an\n          infinite set of actual things or persons or events.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that in a closed\n          system the amount of energy to do work is always decreasing, which when\n          applied to the universe as a whole, means it is constantly being expended and\n          will eventually cease to exist. This implies that the universe cannot be infinite,\n          otherwise it would have already reached an equilibrium end state. The Big\n          Bang theory developed in the 20th century basically states that everything,\n          including matter, energy, space and time, were all compacted into a single\n          point with no dimensions which exploded to form the universe.

This theory is supposedly based on quantum\n          mechanics and Einstein’s general theory of relativity.

Hence, this argument not only says\n          that God exists, but that God must exist to solve this dilemma of contingency.\n          Unlike the Kalam argument, it posits God’s existence without needing to\n          debate the question of an infinite or finite universe.\n        </p>\n      ',subtitle1:"Objections...",key2:'\n      <p>\n        Of course, critics question the necessity of a “necessary being” and\n        question how we know that everything is contingent.

In other words, if there is God, He\n            must exist, but how do we know there is God in the first place?\n          </li>\n        </ol>\n\n        <p>\n          Anselm replied thus, firstly, if you can understand the phrase the “most\n          perfect being” then you have already conceived of such a being. Secondly,\n          there is nothing in the definition of objects (or islands) that necessarily\n          entails perfection, whereas the definition of God entails perfection. Yes, it is\n          true that somebody could imagine a perfect island and this would not entail\n          its existence.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          However, there is no such thing as a truly perfect island because\n          I could always argue that there could always be more coconuts or trees or\n          parrots or levels of perfection ad infinitum. God, on the other hand, is\n          defined by His perfection of attributes and the Is nothing or no one more\n          perfect than He. Thus, since it is more perfect to exist than not, God must,\n          exist.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          As for the third objection, many critics incorrectly assume that Anselm is\n          merely defining God to include existence. What he is really questioning is\n          whether something for which nothing greater can be conceived can exist only\n          in our understanding or intellect. Others like Norman Malcolm have\n          interpreted Anselm’s statements in his “3rd Proslogion” as not assuming\n          existence as a perfection but instead, arguing that God must exist because He\n          is Necessary Being”. In other words, God exists not because existence is a\n          perfection, but because His existence is necessary (the Necessary Being\n          Argument).\n        </p>\n      "},Moral:{title:"Moral Argument",key1:"\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Though it is uncommon to use morality as a primary basis in arguing for the\n            existence of God, it is nonetheless a popular line of thought that morality\n            requires God who is an objective source of moral and ethical commands\n            and possesses the power to enforce these commands by rewarding and\n            punishing act, thereby allowing justice to prevail inthe end. Immanuel Kant\n            however, used the goals of morality to argue for the existence of God. In his\n            view, other rational arguments, such as the ontological and cosmological\n            ones, cannot provide sound proof for the existence of God. He asserts that\n            the aim of morality is what he calls the “Highest Good” and ultimately,\n            hhappiness for self and society.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            In other words, perfect virtue must be\n            rewarded with perfect happiness. The catch, however is that human beings\n            cannot perfectly achieve this Highest Good or virtue in this world, nor is\n            there proportional reward of happiness for virtuous persons. Hence, there is\n            a dilemma with a Highest Good that seems unattainable, but is, nonetheless,\n            necessary end result of morality. To resolve the dilemma, he argues that God\n            must exist in order to reward fidelity to moral commandments and fully\n            realize the Highest Good. Hence, without God the Highest Good cannot be\n            realized.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            Critics of Kant deny that there must be a correlation between morality\n            and happiness and argue that someone may, hence, desite to be virtuous only\n            for the sake of happiness rather than for its own sake. They also use Kant’s own claim that rational arguments are futile in trying to prove God's\n            existence to say that the moral argument is simply another kind of rational\n            argument. However, what Kant claimed was that one bas the right to believe\n            in God, not as a metaphysical or rational tuth, but as a practical and moral\n            necessity. Another criticism surrounds the question of why we should believe\n            inthe ultimate prevalence of justice, for Kant seemingly infers the existence\n            ‘of God fiom what would happen if God existed.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            Other kinds of moral arguments assert that one can infer the existence of\n            God from moral commands. These commands imply the existence of a moral\n            commander of law-giver since each command should have a commander.\n            Others point to the moral conscience or sense of responsibilty and guilt that\n            people often naturally feel with respect to moral duties.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            John Henry Newmans (1801-1890) wrote, “If as is the case, we feel responsibility, are ashamed, are\n            frightened, at transgressing the voice of conscience, this implies that there is.\n            One to whom we are responsible, before whom we are ashamed, whose claim\n            upon us we fear”. Atheists are quick to claim that moral conscience ean be\n            authoritative in itself and does not require answering to a Higher Being.\n            Correspondingly, they claim that moral conscience is merely an outgrowth of\n            Parental, societal and institutional influences instead of a Divine gift.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      "}}},T={Marriage:{},Quran:{},Voilence:{IslamSword:{title:"انتشر السيف الإسلام؟",key1:"كان للإسلام نوعان من الانتشار ، إقليمي وديني. المسلمون استولوا على الأرض بالقوة! كانت هناك مواجهات عسكرية بين الدولة الإسلامية والقوى العالمية الموجودة في روما وبلاد فارس. الإمبراطورية بطبيعتها تحاول التوسع طوال الوقت.",key2:"كانت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية تحاول التوسع ، كانت الإمبراطورية الساسانية تحاول التوسع. فقط 100 سنة مضت ، كانت الإمبراطورية الاستعمارية تفعل الشيء نفسه. حتى اليوم ، أمريكا تفعل الشيء نفسه ، فقط تم تغيير تعريف التوسع. لذا ، كان على الإمبراطورية المسلمة في ذلك الوقت أن تتوسع ، إذا لم تتوسع ، لكانت قد غمرت في إمبراطوريات أخرى.",subtitle1:"بعض التاريخ",key3:"كتب المؤرخون مثل كارول هيلينبراند أن المسلمين الأوائل لم يكن لديهم أسلحة خاصة لغزو البيزنطيين أو الفرس في وقت واحد ، أكبر الجيوش الدائمة على هذا الكوكب. أحد أسباب تقدم المؤرخين لهذا التوسع السريع للإمبراطورية العربية هو أن الجماهير ، الناس على الأرض دعموا التوسع ، رحبوا بهم كمحررين.",key4:"حدث هذا في سوريا ومصر وبلاد فارس وشمال أفريقيا وإسبانيا. عندما وصل طارق بن زياد إلى الأراضي الإسبانية ، تقدم الشعب اليهودي للترحيب بهم كمحررين.",key5:"بحسب برناند لويس ، مؤرخ يهودي ، عاش الشعب اليهودي تحت حماية الإسلام لأكثر من 1000 عام. كان العصر الذهبي اليهودي في إسبانيا ، الأندلس. كانت أقدم أكاديمية يهودية في بغداد. وبالمثل ، عندما تم طرد اليهود من إنجلترا من قبل إدوارد الأول ، ذهبوا إلى إسبانيا ، وبعد ذلك ، عندما طردهم فرديناند وإيزابيلا ، ذهبوا إلى العثمانيين.",subtitle2:"التحويل الإجباري",key6:"كما ذكر سابقاً في قضية الردة ، فإن التحويل القسري محظور في الإسلام. حكم المسلمون مصر وفلسطين ولبنان من القرن الثامن واستمرت الجماعات المسيحية الكبيرة في الوجود على مدى القرون الـ 13 الماضية. حكم المسلمون إسبانيا لمدة 700 عام والهند لمدة 1000 عام دون تحول الغالبية العظمى من السكان إلى الإسلام",subtitle3:"القرن الحادي والعشرين",key7:"كبر دولة إسلامية في العالم اليوم هي إندونيسيا ، التي لديها أكثر من 200 مليون مواطن ، ولم تر قط جنديًا مسلمًا. انتشر الإسلام هناك وفي ماليزيا والفلبين عن طريق التجارة. كان هذا هو حال انتشار الإسلام في دول غرب إفريقيا مثل نيجيريا وغانا والسنغال وتشاد والنيجر.",key8:"من أجبر الأتراك؟ من أجبر المغول؟ من الذي أجبر العلماء وعلماء الرياضيات مثل الدكتور موريس بوكايل ، والدكتور جيفري لانج ، والدكتور أتسوشي أوكادا ، والدكتور غاري ميللر؟ من الذي أجبر شخصيات مثل محمد علي ومايك تايسون ومالكولم إكس وسوني بيل ويليامز على سبيل المثال لا الحصر؟ الإسلام مسألة قلوب. وحتى لو كان هناك من أُجبر على قبول الإسلام ، كان ذلك خطأً تامًا."}},Core:{}},x={"en-us":A,ar:T};i["a"].use(I["a"]);const q=new I["a"]({locale:"en-us",fallbackLocale:"en-us",messages:x});var M=({app:e})=>{e.i18n=q};const H="/";async function S(){const{app:e,router:t}=await k();let n=!1;const a=e=>{n=!0;const i=Object(e)===e?t.resolve(e).route.fullPath:e;window.location.href=i},o=window.location.href.replace(window.location.origin,""),s=[M];for(let h=0;!1===n&&h<s.length;h++)if("function"===typeof s[h])try{await s[h]({app:e,router:t,Vue:i["a"],ssrContext:null,redirect:a,urlPath:o,publicPath:H})}catch(r){return r&&r.url?void(window.location.href=r.url):void console.error("[Quasar] boot error:",r)}!0!==n&&new i["a"](e)}S()},"5b0d":function(e,t,n){}});
