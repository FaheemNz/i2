But if you fear that you will not be just, then marry only one.<cite>- Quran 4:3</cite></blockquote>",subtitle1:"Who is objecting?",key3:"An <b>Atheist</b>, a <b>liberal</b>, a <b>Christian</b>? From an Atheistic paradigm, there is no way anyone could argue that polygamy is immoral, objectively speaking! Liberalism to the rescue but it is not Liberalism itself but the Liberal governments who have disallowed it. Similarly, in the Old & New Testament, almost every prophet practiced polygyny without any exceptions.",key4:"One might say, why can't a Women marry 4 Husbands? However, a woman marrying four husbands would only increase the problem of surplus women. Furthermore, no child would accept his or her mother identifying the father by the <strong>eeny meeny miney mo</strong> method.",key5:"Western anthropologists argue that polygamy is a genetic trait by which the strongest genes of the generation are passed on. Example, the lion king, the strongest of the pack, monopolizes the females thereby ensuring that the next generation of lion cubs will be his offspring.",key6:"Polygamy protects the interests of women and children in society. Men, in Western society, make the laws. They prefer to keep polygamy illegal because it absolves them of responsibility. Legalized polygamy would require them to spend on their additional wives and their offspring.",key7:"Monogamy allows them to enjoy extra-marital affairs without economic consequences. An average American male has at least seven extra premarital or extramarital affairs without any restrictions, according to a poll taken by Chicago Tribune. Also, you can literally see video-interviews of masses about their body-counts, the average number ranges somewhere between 12-20. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man can just move out and the woman has to take care of the child.",key8:"Men created polygamous because of a need in human society. There is normally a surplus of women in most human societies. The surplus is a result of men dying in wars, violent crimes, and women outliving men & the upsurge in homosexuality further increases the problem. If systems do not cater to the need of surplus women it will result in corruption in society.",key9:"An example: Germany after World War II, when suggestions to legalize polygamy were rejected by the Church. Resulting in the legalization of prostitution. German prostitutes are considered as workers like any other profession. They receive health benefits and pay taxes like any other citizen. Furthermore, the rate of marriage has been steadily declining as each succeeding generation finds the institution of marriage more and more irrelevant.",key10:"In the west, they do have polygamy: they just call them girlfriends, while Muslims do it in a legal way. Anyway - unrestricted number of extramarital affairs, unrestricted number of wives, no responsibility - compared to what Islam says i.e 100% responsibility! If you can't do that, marry only one.",subtitle2:"Conclusion",key11:"The question which remains is, “If God is good and wishes good for His creatures, why did he legislate something which would be harmful to most women?” Divine legislation looks at the society as a whole seeking to maximize benefit. If certain legislation benefits the majority of the society and causes some emotional harm to a minority, the general welfare of society is given precedence.",key12:"Plus, Polygamy is not a rule but an exception & it is crystal clear that if a man marries more than one wife (with the permission of his first wife), he has to give equal rights to all of them, if he fails to do so, there are consequences. And remember, this only applies under certain circumstances in some Islamic state - if someone is living in the West, he has to abide by the constitution."},Arranged:{title:"Arranged Marriages",key1:"Forced Marriage has got nothing to do with Islam - it is more of a cultural issue & what is cultural must be separated from what is essential! As a sidenote, in the Quran, there is just one marriage scenario mentioned where a women chooses her husband (Quran 28:23-28).",key2:"Islamic law requires that females must give their permission before they are married. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: <blockquote>A woman without a husband (or divorced or a widow) must not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin must not be married until her permission is sought. They asked the Prophet (PBUH): How her (virgin's) consent can be solicited? He (PBUH) said: That her silence is her consent. <cite> - Sahih Muslim, The Book of Marriage (Kitab Al-Nikah), Book 008, Number 3303 </blockquote>On one occasion a woman came to the Prophet (PBUH) and informed him that her father had married her off without her permission. He offered to annul her marriage, however, she did not accept his offer saying that she only wanted to confirm her right - A previously married woman has the right to choose for herself. The Quran says: <blockquote>O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good. <cite> - Quran 4:19</cite></blockquote>",key3:"But wait a second, the Prophet (PBUH) also said: <blockquote>The marriage of any woman who marries herself without her guardian's consent is invalid. <cite>- Book 9, Hadith 1879 (Authentic)</cite></blockquote> This is why you just can't go to extremes on either side - Parents have their rights & children have their rights! The Hadith has to be juxtaposed with all the other Qur'anic ayahs and Hadiths & must not be taken out of context to fit one's narrative.",key4:"If the guardian refuses proposals for illegitimate reasons like the persons tribe, race, color, status, the young lady has the right to seek redress from the court. If the judge concludes that the father is wrongfully preventing his daughter from marriage, he may take the guardianship from the father and act as the girls guardian. ",key5:"Muslims are encouraged to help their children find suitable marital partners since males and females are raised separately in society. Women are spared having to look for their own mates. From a Western perspective, where teenagers are often required to leave home and go out to work and look after themselves, it would seem ludicrous for parents to, later on, suggest whom they should marry.",key6:"Similarly, It has become a practice among some Muslims to force their children to marry their cousins. For Muslims in the West, it becomes a means to help their family members also reach the West. Consequently, there have been a number of cases reported in the newspapers in England of the Home Office rescuing Muslim girls from forced marriages at the airport. There are also many Muslim girls who have run away from home rather than be forced to marry relatives in villages in Pakistan or India. Such girls are being given new identities by police authorities and will likely lose their Islaam in the process.",subtitle1:"Double standard in Marriage?",key7:"One might ask, why Muslim males are allowed to marry non-Muslim females but Muslim females are only allowed to marry Muslim males. This is often cited as discrimination and one of the symbols of oppression of Muslim females. The reply will be:",key8:"Muslim males are not allowed to marry any non-Muslim female. Only Christians and Jews (People of the Book) and not any other religion. This is due to the fact that the scriptures held sacred by Christians and Jews do contain large portions of revelation even though the texts have been distorted and changed. Consequently, in honor of the revelation still remaining in these texts, permission was granted to marry their women. However, the condition of chastity is added to the permission mentioned in the Qur'an.",key9:"Consequently, only a woman who is either a virgin, divorcee or widow can be married. This means that the common practice of Muslims from the East coming to Europe and America and finding blue-eyed blondes in discos for wives is quite illegitimate. Finding chaste females in the West is more difficult than finding the proverbial “needle in the haystack.” By mid-teens, virginity is looked at as a fault rather than a virtue.",key10:"The reason for allowing men and not women is in order to protect the woman’s religion. If a Muslim man requested his non-Muslim wife not to bring alcohol or pork in his house and that she not wear mini-skirts or kiss his friends, she could comply without affecting her religious teachings. However, If a non-Muslim husband requested his Muslim wife to purchase alcohol and serve him pork, to wear mini-skirts and kiss his friends since it is his custom to kiss the wives of his friends. It is natural for a wife to try to please her husband. In the case of the Muslim wife, that could lead to the destruction of her faith.",key11:"Marriage to non-Muslims is discouraged in situations where Muslims are weak or in the minority in order to safeguard the religion of the children.

The right for women to inherit and own property was only given to women in the West at the turn of the century, whereas that right was given to women in Islaam 1,400 years ago.",key3:"Furthermore, in the West, a person may legally write a will giving all of their wealth to their dog or cat and exclude their wife, children, and other relatives. In the Islamic system, the rights of wives, children and relatives to inherit are protected. Set portions of the inheritance to be given to them are identified in the Quran.",key4:"No one can write a will and cancel or modify what is due to them. A will can be written to give up to a maximum of one third to those who would not inherit by law. As to leaving even the third of one’s wealth to animals, the Muslim State could step in on behalf of the inheritors and cancel such a will as it obviously indicates some form of mental disorder. The third would then be divided up among the natural inheritors.",key5:"In an Islaamic society men are responsible for the maintenance of women. For example, if a son, a daughter and a mother inherit, the son also has the additional responsibility of looking after his sister and his mother. Consequently, based on the male role, Islamic Law awards the son twice the portion of the daughter.",key6:"However, the two to one division is not applied in all cases. For example, the Quran states (4: 11): “If a man or woman [died and] left neither descendants for ascendants, but left behind a brother or a sister, each gets 1/6th; and if they are more than two, they equally share 1/3rd.",key7:"So it is not black and white & different things should be treated differently on account of their difference."},WomenWitness:{title:"Two women equal to one Man",key1:"The finger is also pointed at Islaam as considering women inferior since the witness of one man is equal to that of two women.",key2:"The Quran does state in Al-Baqarah (2: 282): Get two of your men as witnesses. But if two men are not available, then get a man and two women agreeable to you as witnesses, so that if one of them makes a mistake, the other can remind her... However, this principle is not applied in all cases. This is specific to business contracts as the beginning of the verse indicates.",key3:"This consideration may seem quaint in the West where women have been a part of the workforce for much of the 20th century. Women entered the workforce as a product of the need for them in the society and the munitions factories during the two World Wars. Millions of men in their prime were sent overseas to fight and their jobs had to be filled by women. Once the wars ended, many refused to return to their homes, and the feminist movement was born.",key4:"Eventually, many women came to look at fulfillment in the workplace and not at home. Even if her job was only that of a secretary, harassed by her boss, smiling sheepishly to keep her job, she felt it was better than being stuck at home cooking, washing dishes, changing diapers and preparing bottles of milk. Many Western women became familiar with business dealings, so the previously mentioned considerations would seem to them irrelevant. However, even in America, the vast majority of women are housewives, spending most of their lives in their homes, while their husbands work and bring home the bread.",key5:"Nonetheless, In areas of female expertise, the witness of a single woman is sufficient. The witness in Islam is different than the narrator. The narrator narrates the Hadith, they are basically narrating all the way back to Prophet (PBUH) and as we know some of the greatest Narrator in Hadith are women e.g <strong>Aisha (RA)</strong>, and one woman equal one man in this context, as a narrator of the Hadith. <strong>This is more important than anything else because you are transmitting the deen itself, so as a narrator there is no suspect or indifferent treatment between man and woman.</strong>",key6:"So it is a witness we need to talk about. Why it is always said that women have fewer rights as witnesses, <strong>why not fewer responsibilities</strong>? Punitively and classically, what happens to the witnesses if they are seen to speak falsehood? They get lashed - even if one of four witnesses is caught lying, all of the 4 are lashed. If this was the case, and a woman was being lashed and she didn't do anything wrong, the objection would have been: how can you punish the woman when she did nothing wrong? If we did have the same responsibilities for man and woman in this context, then there would be complaints as described before.",key7:"Considering the punitive repercussions of false testimony, this is preferential treatment for women. It is a mercy from Allah that he doesn't put a woman in that position because why would they be put in a position where they are susceptible to more physical pain, in an <strong>Islamic state</strong>."}},Violence:{Jihad:{title:"Jihad",key1:"Usually translated by the Western media as “holy war” is a greatly misunderstood principle in Islaam.

Kings, for example, speak with the plural - actually not only Kings but presidents, today, speak with the plural i.e we have won the election, etc. Same is the case with Torah albeit Jews don\'t believe in trinity but one God.</p>\n\n      <p>\n        As a sidenote, Arabic is a different language compared to English! People think there are problems with the language of the Quran when in fact, the problem is with the language itself! Just to give an example - in English, there is one plural i.e the plural of the word disbeliever would be disbelievers but in Arabic, the plural(s) of the word \'الكافر\' (disbeliever) would be \'الكفار\' (disbelievers) and \'كافرون\' (disbelievers).\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Anyway, in the Quran you will find different kind of pronouns used for Allah & to understand this, you will have to understand what are the different kinds of pronouns:\n        <ol>\n          <li>3rd person - He, she, and they</li>\n          <li>2nd person - You</li>\n          <li>1st person - I and We</li>\n        </ol>\n\n        In the Arabic language, there are 6 kinds of you. When in the 3rd person, Allah uses "he", in the 2nd person Allah uses "you" (singular), Allah doesn\'t use "they"! He uses singular 3rd person, singular 2nd person, and the only time he uses the plural is in 1st person! If it was literally a plural, you should have found it in the 1st person, 2nd person, and the 3rd person.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Now, when Allah is being formal or if Allah is distancing himself from a group of people, you will find the word "he" in the Quran - why, because the 3rd person is the most distant pronoun. Whenever a servant talks to Allah, he uses the word "you" not "he", in the Quran. And, what is left is I and We - <strong>Allah uses the word "I" in extreme love or extreme anger</strong> (please verify this yourself) & <strong>the word "We" in the role of a majesty</strong>.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        For example, in the following verse, he uses the word "We" not "I" (expressing majesty): \n        \n        <blockquote>Indeed, it is We who sent down the Qur\'an and indeed, We will be its guardian.\n        <cite>- Quran 15:9</cite></blockquote>\n        <blockquote>We have decreed death among you, and We are not to be outdone. In that, We will change your likenesses and produce you in that [form] which you do not know. And you have already known the first creation, so will you not remember?\n        <cite>- Quran 56:60-62</cite></blockquote>\n\n        But in the following verse, he doesn\'t use the word "We" but "I" (expressing anger):\n        <blockquote>And believe in what I have sent down confirming that which is [already] with you, and be not the first to disbelieve in it. And do not exchange My signs for a small price, and fear [only] Me.\n        <cite>- Quran 2:41</cite></blockquote>\n        <blockquote>Then I swear by the setting of the stars, And indeed, it is an oath - if you could know - [most] great. Then is it to this statement that you are indifferent?\n        <cite>- Quran 56:75-76-81</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Just to get the point across - imagine a king or president is giving a speech, whenever he mentions elections or policies, he uses the word "we" but during the speech, someone from the audience disturbs him, he won\'t say: "we have become angry" but "I have become angry" & similarly, during the speech, his son/daughter walks by, he won\'t say: "we love you" but "I love you".\n      </p>\n      '},AllahAsHe:{title:"Why does the Quran refer to Allah as 'He'?",key1:'\n        <p>This is linked to the previous question. The question is that in the Quran, you find that Allah uses the word "he" for himself. The word "he" is obviously male, so how can we use the male word for God even though Allah is beyond gender?</p>\n\n        <p>\n          As mentioned earlier, the Arabic language works differently than the English language. In the English language, you have 3 options - you can use "he" or "she" or "it". "He" is a male connotation, "she" is a female connotation and "it" is beyond gender. So you would have the choice of "it" but the problem is the word "it" is for inanimate objects, so "it" would be inappropriate for Allah because it necessitates the assumption that it\'s a non-living thing.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          None of the aforementioned 3 options can truly do justice for Allah. In the Arabic language, there is no "it", there is just "he" and "she". Grammatically speaking, the word "he" in the Arabic language serves 2 functions i.e male and masculine & actually <strong>before it even serves the function of male, its primary purpose is to communicate the masculine</strong>.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          In the Arabic language, the word "he" can be used for things that have gender and things that don\'t have gender & it is more about grammar than biology. E.g sun in Arabic is feminine! Is sun biologically female? Masculine and feminine are different from males and females.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The question assumes because the English language uses the word "he" for "males", the Arabic equivalent must also be used for males. This is where understanding Arabic linguistics and the overall structure of the Arabic language helps. As an overview, Arabic language as a construct has certain principles that dictate how the whole language is organized and one of those guiding principles is that the masculine is the default - a word will remain masculine until there is a reason to consider it feminine, you don\'t get out of the masculine gender unless you have some grammatical reason.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          The fact that "he" is used for Allah actually indicates that this is the default, it is how it is supposed to be. The problem doesn\'t exist at all in Arabic but in English - that is the reason no one since the inception of the Quran, actually attributed masculinity to Allah - even among the Pagan Arabs. In English, we have to use the word "he" as we don\'t have a better word. If there was a word in English called "Hie" & the English Grammar rule was to use "Hie" with things that don\'t have gender & are living, no one would have thought about the question being discussed. One might say, the word "Hie" doesn\'t make any sense - to which the reply would be, how does "He" or "She" or "it" make any sense?   \n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          We take language for granted! Let\'s develop a new language right now & name it <strong>Enblish</strong>: The word for he in Enblish is "ζב", the word for she in Enblish is "בζ" and the word for majesty and power in Enblish is "ζφά". Problem solved! Now when translating from Arabic to Enblish, the word "ζφά" will be used and no one will ever object as it literally means majesty & royalty! \n        </p>\n\n        <p>This might sound funny but this is how languages are developed!

In all the narrations where the Companions differed from each other, it was clear that each one hail been taught directly from the Prophet (PBUH), who was inspired by Allah. \n        <blockquote>\n        Narrated Umar bin Al-Khattab that I heard Hisham bin Hakim bin Hizam reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way different to that of mine. Allah's Messenger (PBUH) had taught it to me (in a different way). So, I was about to quarrel with him (during the prayer) but I waited till he finished, then I tied his garment round his neck and seized him by it and brought him to Allah's Messenger (PBUH) and said, \"I have heard him reciting Surat-al-Furqan in a way different to the way you taught it to me.\" The Prophet (PBUH) ordered me to release him and asked Hisham to recite it. When he recited it, Allah s Apostle said, \"It was revealed in this way.\" He then asked me to recite it. When I recited it, he said, \"It was revealed in this way. The Qur'an has been revealed in seven different ways, so recite it in the way that is easier for you.\"\n        <cite><a href='https://sunnah.com/bukhari/44/9' target='blank'>- Sahih Bukhari 2419</a></cite></blockquote>\n        </li>\n        <li>The reason the Prophet (PBUH) requested the number of ahruf to be increased was to make the memorisation and recitation of the Qur'aan easier for his Ummah. The Prophet (PBUH) prayed to increase the ahrufs:\n        \n        <blockquote>\n        The Messenger of Allah (PBUH) met Jibra'il and said: 'O Jibra'il! I have been sent to an illiterate nation among whom are the elderly woman, the old man, the boy and the girl, and the man who cannot read a book at all.' He said: 'O Muhammad!

It can be assumed that the Prophet (PBUH) chose the particular harf to recite to a Companion depending on which one would be the easiest for that particular Companion to memorise, since the purpose of the ahruf was to simplify recitation and memorisation. The Prophet (PBUH) did not teach all the ahruf to all the Companions, for 'Umar and Hishaam did not know about the existence of the different ahruf. Also, the cause for Ubay's doubts was the fact that he was unaware of these ahruf and the Prophet (PBUH) had to pray to Allah to remove his doubts.</li>\n        <li> The differences between these ahrufs were not so great as to prevent recognition of what was being recited. In other words, even though Hishaam was reciting the Qur'aan in a different harf than Umar, Umar could still recognise that Hishaam was reciting Surah al-Furqaan, thus showing that the ahruf were not radically different from each other. Also, the narration of Ibn Shihaab shows that the basic meaning of all these ahruf was the same.</li>\n        <li>Each one of these ahruf is complete in and of itself. The proof for this is the statement of the Prophet (PBUH) \"...so whichever one of them they recite, they are correct.\" This is not to say that the ahruf do not complement one another in meaning, but rather that the recitation of the Qur'aan in one harf is sufficient.</li>\n        <li>A last benefit that can be inferred from these hadeeth (although this is not relevant to the ahruf) is the concern shown by the Companions in the preservation of the correct recitation of the Qur'aan. In all the cases quoted above, the Companions were not content with listening to recitations that were different from theirs despite the fact that these recitations were said lo have been learnt from\n        the Prophet (PBUH) - until they had taken the matter to the Prophet (PBUH) himself.</li>\n      </ul> \n      ",subtitle3:"Are Ahruf in existence today?",key4:"\n      <p>This question in essence depends upon how one defines theohruf. For example, az-Zarqaanee strongly argues that all the ahruf have been preserved, but this goes back to his definition that the ahruf represent seven ways that the verse can be changed. Thus, since these variations are still present in today's qiraa't, he argues that all seven ahruf have been preserved. The present discussion will, of course, utilise the definition that was concluded upon in the previous section.</p>\n      \n      <p>The scholars of Islam are divided into three opinions with regards to this issue:</p>\n      \n      <ol>\n        <li>\n        The first group of scholars, composed of at-Tabaree, at-Tahaawee , Ibn Hibbaan and those who follow them, argue that only one harf is in existence today. At-Tabaree holds that the recitation of the Qur'aan in seven ahruf was a concession given to the Companions at the time of the Prophet (PBUH), but when Uthmaan(RA) officially compiled the Qur'aan, he specifically ordered the committee assigned to write the mushaf to preserve only one harf. He is alluding to the statement of Uthmaan(RA):\n        \n        <blockquote>Uthman called Zaid bin Thabit, Abdullah bin Az-Zubair, Said bin Al-As and AbdurRahman bin Al-Harith bin Hisham, and then they wrote the manuscripts of the Holy Qur'an in the form of book in several copies. Uthman said to the three Quraishi persons: If you differ with Zaid bin Thabit on any point of the Qur'an, then write it in the language of Quraish, as the Qur'an was revealed in their language. So they acted accordingly.\n        <cite><a href='https://sunnah.com/bukhari/61/16' target='blank'>- Sahih Bukhari 3506</a></cite>\n        </blockquote>\n        This, according to al-Tabaree anil those who follow his opinion, shows that Uthmaan preserved only one harf.</li>\n        \n        <li>The second group of scholars holds thai all ofthe ahrufs are in existence today, and  the mushaf of Uthmaan(RA) was written to preserve all seven ahruf. This was the opinion of Aboo Bakr al-Baqillaani, and a small group of scholars. They claim that the Companions would never abandon a recitation that they used to recite during the lifetime of the Prophet (PBUH). anD thaT they would not discard any knowledge that the Prophet (PBUH) had given them.</li>\n        <li>The third group of scholars is composed ol ash-Shaatibee, ar-Raazee, Ibn Katheer, Ibn al-Jazaree and others. They argue that Uthmaan preserved the ahruf to the extent that the script of his mushaf allowed him to do so. Thus, these scholars hold that a portion of the seven ahruf arc preserved.</li>\n      </ol>\n      \n      <p>The third opinions seem to be the strongest for the following reasons:</p>\n      \n      <ol>\n        <li>The Companions were meticulous in preserving the knowledge that they received from the Prophet (PBUH). They understood their responsibility in transferring this vast knowledge to the ummah. It is because of this concern of theirs that detailed information exists about every topic of Islam, so much so that the Muslims even know how many white hairs the Prophet's (PBUH) beard contained! Therefore, it cannot be said that the Companions purposely left out six ahrufs and preserved only one of them in the mushaf of Uthmaan (RA) without bringing forth some strong, unequivocal proof.</li>\n        <li>The Uthmaanic mushafs, as was mentioned earlier, were devoid of dots and vowel points. Since this knowledge was available to the Arabs at that time, it seems likely that the mushaf was purposely written without these dots or inflection points so that it would encompass different readings, and hence the different ahruf. Also, as was mentioned in the relevant chapter, the script of the Uthmaanic mushaf written with specific rules in mind, apparently in order to accommodate the various recitations, and this shows that the mushaf written with the intent to preserve more than one harf.</li>\n        <li>If, as al-Tabaree holds, only one harf has been preserved, From where then do the differences in the ten qiraats originate from? All scholars are unanimous that these ten qira'aat originated from the Prophet (PBUH) himself; therefore is seems apparent that the qiraaat have some integral relationship with the ahruf.</li>\n        <li>The different mushafs that Uthmaan ordered to be written were not identical to each other, for in a number ot places, the addition or deletion of a word or letter occurred in some ol the mushafs. This change is reflected in the various qiraaat in existence today, for within the ten qiraaat, there exist word changes and word additions that could not have originated Irom the same mushaf. It seems apparent this\n        was done with a goal in mind, and the strongest conclusion seems to be that, by these differences in the mushafs, Uthmaan had intended to preserve the differences in the ahrufs.</li>\n      </ol>\n      ",subtitle4:"Why different Ahrufs?",key5:"\n      <p>Obviously, it cannot be said for certain the exact wisdom behind any Divine act, for the Creator's knowledge is infinite.

This is the only benefit that is explicitly narrated in the hadecth. The Arabs did not all speak Arabic in the same way i.e each tribe and location had slight variations anil peculiarities unique to it.

Now, if any type of natural disaster strikes on <strong>country x</strong>, <strong>country y</strong> won't care - there is no problem of evil according to <strong>country y</strong> relative to <strong>country x</strong> and vice versa.

One thing that is often overlooked is sexual objectification and commodification. Really and truly, if you look at the contents of most male magazines, you will find that the majority of the information that is presented in those magazines are the pictures of women.

As God transcends space, we naturally would not associate with Him spatial limitations. For instance, we would not say that God literally descends to earth or walks in the garden. Equally, we would not insist that God is a three-dimensional being or that He travels from one point in space to another.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      In the same way, we should not demand that God have a past, present, and future, for this assumes that His existence is as ours, in time, and again this conflicts with His transcendence. Even the most rabid atheist, in an effort to prove the illogic of the concept of God,\n      would not suppose that God might be on a bus from Chicago on His way to New Orleans because he knows that such a hypothesis is unacceptable to a believer. It is equally erroneous to assume God\'s being was confined to a particular point or interval of time.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      We have little difficulty accepting the idea that God\'s knowledge can encompass two different points in space simultaneously. This is perhaps because we assume that the attribute of transcending space implies a unique vantage point. We could compare it, however imperfectly, to the experience of being high above the ground and having simultaneous knowledge of very distant events. With respect to time, unlike space, we are immobile.\n      We can not travel forward or backward in time. \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      An hour from now, we will\n      be at an hour from now. That can not be changed. Therefore, it is more difficult to comprehend that God\'s existence is independent of or beyond time, as indeed it must be, for it is impossible to conceive that His being is contained within or constrained by any of the dimensions of the very spacetime environment that He created for us to live and grow in. Once again, because of His unique vantage, point, His knowledge encompasses all events, regardless of their distance in space or time.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Another key point, well established in the Qur\'an, is that our perception of time is not objectively real. As noted earlier, the Day of Judgment is portrayed as a different order of creation, one in which we suddenly comprehend that our former perceptions of time are no longer valid.\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>It will be, on the Day they see it, as though they had not remained [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morning thereof. <cite>- Quran 79:46</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>And on the Day when He will gather them, [it will be] as if they had not remained [in the world] but an hour of the day, [and] they will know each other.<cite>- Quran 10:45</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>They will murmur among themselves, You remained not but ten [days in the world]. We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in a manner will say, "You remained not but one day."\n      <cite>- Quran 20:103-104</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>He will say, How long did you remain on earth in a number of years? They will say, We remained a day or part of a day; ask those who enumerate. He will say, You stayed not but a little - if only you had known.\n      <cite>- Quran 23:112-114</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>\n      Interpreters will always render all references to the Day of Judgment in\n      the future tense, because from our perspective that is when it will take place. Several of the passages, however, actually employ the present and past tenses. Commentators assert that this is a literary device that stresses the inevitability of these happenings, but it seems that the use of the present and past tenses in referring to the Day of Judgment also reinforces the notion that it will take place in a very different environment, one in which our current conceptions of time and space no longer apply.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The question "What is the value of prayer if God has already predestined the future?" assumes that in some way God has a future. That is, it assumes that God is situated in time, as we are, and that as we pray,\n      He is peering into a preordained future. But in order to have a future, one\'s existence must be contained within-and hence finite-in time. The reason this question leads to contradictions is that it assumes a contradiction in the first place: that God both transcends and is finite in time.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Any question that assumes two mutually incompatible premises will always result in conflicting conclusions. Assume, for example, that a circle is a square. We may ask if a circle has corners. If we emphasize the circle\'s roundness, the answer is no. If we concentrate on the properties of a square, the answer is yes. When two assumptions lead to a contradiction, at least one of them must be false. Thus, in such a situation, it should be asked if the question itself makes sense, and if all premises are necessarily true.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The word "predestination" is itself problematic. If we mean by it that\n      God in the past had programmed the events of the future, the assumption is that God exists in time. If instead, we mean that God\'s wisdom, knowledge,\n      and power encompass all and nothing in creation can conflict with that,\n      then that has to be admitted. However, this is not the primary sense of "predestine," which means "determine in advance," and it does not conflict with the notion that God responds to our prayers.\n      </p>\n      ',subtitle1:"If Allah knows everything then where is the test?",key2:"\n      <p>\n        The very first question that must be asked is, what are the things Allah won't do - the things that would stop Allah from being Allah? For example, Allah is All-Knowing, One, and Wise. If Allah stops being any of these, he stops being Allah. So the question is, can Allah create a scenario whereby we are doing our own things by our free-will & Allah is doing it at the same time?\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The only reason one might say, no, this is not possible is that it would stop Allah being Allah. But as Allah is competent over all things, he can create such a situation - no matter how overwhelming it is for us to fathom, the hows of it, the metaphysics of it, the strings of it - we are not gonna get this. There are 2 tests basically, one which Allah has filled out for us, and the second which we have to write ourselves - and both of them are corresponding! How? Allah knows best! \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Some people keep forcing their made-up projections on Allah that he created us but as he is all-knowing, he knows the outcome already. Whatever answer, whatever analogy you will give, it will default back to this 'all-knowing' attribute or 'these are just Human analogies'! This is a loophole & the response is very simple: if Allah is all-powerful then of course he can create a situation where whatever someone thinks is happening doesn't happen! Why do you accept his all-knowing attribute but reject the all-powerful attribute?\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The following Quranic verses are telling a completely different story:\n        \n        <blockquote>Say, Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying. <strong>Say, With Allah is the biggest argument. Had he willed, He would have guided you all.</strong><cite>- Quran 6:148-149</cite></blockquote>\n\n        <blockquote>And that our foolish one has been saying about Allah an excessive transgression. And we had thought that mankind and the jinn would never speak about Allah a lie.\n        <cite>- Quran 72:4-5</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Nowadays, People talk about meta-physics as if they have understood everything else. We don't even know who we are, e.g there is something which is active in our body which we call 'I' - one might say which body part of one's body is 'I'? What makes 'We' we? It is not the eyes, or nose, or legs, or arms, or hairs, or face, or feet! It is not the heart or brain as they keep working for some time even after one is dead! So basically, even if the whole universe come together, they won't be able to tell what is this thing called 'soul' or 'consciousness'! Amazing...</p>\n      "},EternalHellfire:{title:"Hellfire",key1:'\n      <p>\n      The objection is, why Allah creates a Human which he knows will end up in hell? Why doesn\'t he create other people, give them free-will, and judge? To which the response is: if he should not create a Human which he knows will end up in hell, why should he create a Human which he knows will end up in Paradise even after giving him free-will? Why not directly put him in Paradise? E.g Adam (PBUH) was in Paradise to begin with - so why take him out of Paradise just to put him back there once again? And the loophole continues... \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      And once again, this goes back to, why create Humans in the first place? And once again, the answer Allah gives is: <blockquote>And mention, when your Lord said to the angels, Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority. They said, Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You? Allah said, Indeed, I know that which you do not know.<cite>- Quran 2:30</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p><i>I know what you don\'t know</i> & yet there is dispute. This question is a result of silly riddles most often arise from imposing unnecessary and contradictory assumptions on certain attributes of God or by assigning unwarranted additional attributes to him. As mentioned before, the real question is, can Allah create a scenario where this doesn\'t happen? Look at what the Quran is saying about all these silly riddles and assumptions:</p>\n\n      <blockquote>Those who associated with Allah will say, "If Allah had willed, we would not have associated [anything] and neither would our fathers nor would we have prohibited anything." Likewise, did those before deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, "Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying." <br /> <strong>Say, "With Allah is the biggest argument. Had he willed, He would have guided you all."</strong><cite>- Quran 6:148-149</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>If people were directly put in Hell, they would soon argue that Allah did not test them or give them the opportunity to strive. They\'ll have no such argument on the Day of Resurrection. They were given reason, messengers and books were sent as the Quran says: </p>\n\n      <blockquote>And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, "Our Lord, why did You not send to us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced?"\n      <cite>- Quran 20:136</cite></blockquote>\n      \n      <p>We just can\'t fathom how all of this works, we will never get it but for Allah, it is very easy. For example, Take a robot, no matter how hard it tries, it will never know the <strong>whats & whys</strong> beyond the limit which is set by the one who has developed it - but for the one who has developed it, it is dead simple. Isn\'t the same case with Humans?</p>\n      ',subtitle2:"Eternal Hellfire",key2:"\n      <p>This question is linked with the previous one & the answer is very simple - we are not given license to judge salvation! In the Quran, Allah is speaking, and he can speak however he likes! We can't speak on his behalf. For example, just like a king is speaking and there are hundreds of servants in his court - the king becomes angry at 'servant x' and says something loudly and the 'servant y' repeats the same sentence, who do you think is in trouble? To put things in perspective, the Quran says to the Prophet (PBUH):</p>\n      \n      <blockquote>Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like...<cite>- Quran 28:56</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>Similarly, Prophet (PBUH) once said to her daughter Fatima (RA): \n      <blockquote>O Fatimah, rescue thyself from the Fire, for I have no power (to protect you) from Allah in anything except this that I would sustain a relationship with you.<cite>- Sahih Muslim (Book 1, Number 0399)</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Remember, don't take Hadiths out of context. The above Hadith have a context, Prophet (PBUH) said this when the following verse was revealed: <blockquote>And warn your nearest kindred...<cite>- Quran 26:214</cite></blockquote></p>\n\n      <p>Similarly, the Quran says everyone will come individually on the day of Judgement and who are the people who are safe? The ones who have a sound heart as the Quran says: <blockquote>\"The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail. But only he (will prosper) that brings to Allah a sound heart<cite>- Quran 26:88-89</cite></blockquote>\n      Now how do we know someone has a sound heart? We don't! Nonetheless, something that is worth considering is: Allah wants to guide us, he doesn't want to punish us:\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>What would Allah do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe?<cite>- Quran 4:147</cite></blockquote>\n      <blockquote>And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.<cite>- Quran 11:101</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>There are some people who are worried about hellfire being <strong>eternal</strong> but again, they are just following assumptions. It is up to Allah to do whatever he likes with whoever he likes! The one who is using Eternal hellfire as an argument, one might ask where did you get this, he will say, from the Quran! But the same book, the same source is also saying Allah is just & loving. If he is saying he is just then you have to be rest assured, no injustice will happen to a Muslim or a non-Muslim!</p>\n\n      <p>If someone deserves the hellfire, he will confess it himself! If he himself doesn't have a problem then there is no room for dispute! As the Quran says: \n      <blockquote>They will say, “Our Lord, You gave us death twice and You gave us life twice. Now we confess our sins. So, is there any way to come out of here?” <cite>- Quran 40:11</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote>Thus they will confess their sin. So, away with the people of Hell!\n      <cite>- Quran 67:11</cite></blockquote>\n      <blockquote>They will say, \"Our Lord, our wretchedness overcame us, and we were a people astray. Our Lord, remove us from it, and if we were to return [to evil], we would indeed be wrongdoers.\" He will say, \"Remain despised therein and do not speak to Me. Indeed, there was a party of My servants who said, 'Our Lord, we have believed, so forgive us and have mercy upon us, and You are the best of the merciful.' But you took them in mockery to the point that they made you forget My remembrance, and you used to laugh at them.\n      <cite>- Quran 23:106-110</cite></blockquote>\n      <blockquote>Man will be informed that Day of what he sent ahead and kept back. Rather, man, against himself, will be a witness, Even if he presents his excuses.\n      <cite>- Quran 75:13-15</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>One more thing that must be considered here is, the punishment depends on the severity of the crime. If a 20 years old kills someone & he is sentenced to a lifetime jail, is it just? It took 1 second to pull the trigger so the punishment must be 1 second? We can double it, 2 seconds? 3 seconds? 1 minute? 1 hour? 1 day? 1 month? 2 months? 1 year? 2 years? Forever??? See, this fallacious analogy doesn't even work in this life.</p>\n\n      <p>About the hellfire being eternal: what do you mean by the word \"eternal\"? Again going back to what is being alluded to, we don't know! We don't know what 'eternal hellfire' means in the next life! To put things in perspective, whenever the Quran talks about hellfire being eternal, it uses the word <strong>خالدون</strong> which is translated as <strong>eternal</strong>. However, in 3 places (regarding hell), the word <strong>الأبد</strong> is explicitly added to the word <strong>خالدون</strong> albeit they both have the same meaning! Why?</p>\n\n      <p>\n      Anyway, whenever the heaven and hell are mentioned together, Allah uses the word <strong>الأبد</strong> with heaven but not with hell. See Chapter 98-6,98-8 & 64:9, 64:10. According to some, hellfire will come to an end - others say it is eternal! Similarly, in the following verse, different wording is used:\n      <blockquote>\n      In which they will remain for ages [unending].\n      <cite>- Quran 78:23</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Notice the word that is used is <strong>اَحقَابًا</strong> which means successive periods. According to most scholars from early generations, Huqq'b is 80 years. The main point is, we can't question Allah about anything - as the Quran says: <blockquote>He is not questioned about what He does, but they will be questioned.<cite>- Quran 21:23</cite></blockquote> \n      Maybe, Allah has literally given us a hint by adding the word <strong>الأبد</strong> to not indulge into the knowledge of the unseen. It is up to him to do whatever he wills.</p>\n      "},Music:{title:"Music in Islam",key1:"\n      <p>The general impression among some ignorant Muslims is that Islaam prohibits music.\n      However, that is not the case.</p>\n\n      <ul>\n        <li>\n          God made human nature such that it loves music, especially in the case of children.\n          Islaamic law does not prohibit music but regulates it by banning only its harmful\n          aspects.\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          The Prophet (PBUH) prohibited the use of wind and stringed instruments in a well known\n          hadeeth saying: <blockquote>There will be people of my nation who will legalize fornication, the\n          wearing of silk, drinking wine and the use of musical instruments... <cite>- <a href='https://sunnah.com/bukhari/74/16' target='blank'>Sahih al-Bukhari 5590</a></cite></blockquote> \n          He also prohibited males from listening to adult female singers saying, “Some people from my\n          nation will drink wine, calling it another name.

Where homosexuality was considered an illness by the Association of Psychiatrists, it is now removed from the list and replaced by homophobia (the dislike of homosexuals and homosexuality).\n        Consequently, Islaam and Muslims are considered intolerant and biased due to their continued opposition. Arguments in favor of tolerance to homosexuals are based on the assumption that homosexual behavior is biologically based and not merely learned from society.\n        </p>\n        \n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Early opposition to homosexuality was based on the argument that such behavior was\n              unnatural. Sodomy cannot produce children which is one of the main natural\n              consequences of sexual relations. “Mother Nature” did not make us that way, it was\n              argued. To counter such arguments homosexual researchers scoured the earth until\n              they found supposed homosexual behavior among the animal kingdom.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n            They found that the males of some species of exotic fishes of the coast of Japan imitated the\n            behavior of females of the species in order to prevent other males from impregnating\n            their mates, and some rare butterflies from islands of the coast of Africa also had\n            males exhibiting female behavior during mating season, etc. However, if the animal\n            kingdom is to be used to justify human behavior, there also exists a spider in South\n            America, whose female is much larger than the male.

However, this\n              evidence, while seeming incontrovertible to the layman, was immediately refuted by\n              scientists. The data was taken from cross-sections of the brains of dead adult humans\n              whose sexual preference was identified prior to death. Consequently, the reduced size\n              among homosexuals could have been a result of the practice and not its cause. That is,\n              they could have been born with normal-sized glands which then became small due to\n              their deviant lifestyle.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Recently genetics has become the most commonly used foundation for the pro-gay\n              argument.

He gave expert testimony to the Colorado\n              Supreme Court that formed the basis of the victorious decision striking down anti-gay\n              Proposition. However, a replication of his study at the University of Western\n              Ontario failed to find any linkage whatsoever between the X chromosome and sexual orientation.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              It was also found that Hamer’s study lacked a control group; a fundamental principle of scientific research. Furthermore, in June 1994, the Chicago Tribune reported that a junior researcher in Hamer’s laboratory who assisted in the gene mapping in the homosexuality study, alleged that he selectively reported his data. She was then summarily dismissed from her post-doctoral fellowship in\n              Hamer’s lab. But a National Institutes of Health investigation substantiated her claims and gave her another position in a different lab.

It later spread to the heterosexual community through blood\n            transfusions and intravenous drug usage and so-called bisexuals.

To accept such a proposition is to accept that God\n              is unjust. Inclinations can exist within humans for a variety of natural and unnatural\n              acts, from fornication to rape and from necrophilia to bestiality. These inclinations\n              may come from jinn-suggestions, media influence, or even from human whisperings\n              or direct contact.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Human beings are not like robots who only do what they are\n              programmed to do.

Currently, some scientists are even\n              claiming that murder is of genetic origin. To accept that would mean to excuse\n              murderers and tolerate murder.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            <p>\n              Islaam instructs parents to separate their children in their beds by the age of ten in\n              order to avoid sexual experiences which may result from childhood experimentation.\n              Such experiences may be reinforced by contacts in schools and through abuse from\n              adults. Also the distinctions between males and females are strongly made in Islaamic\n              teachings. The Prophet cursed men who imitated women and women who imitated\n              men. The Western fashion industry is controlled by homosexuals who attempt to blur\n              the distinction between males and females in order to make their behavior more\n              acceptable.\n            </p>\n\n            <p>\n              Consequently, men’s fashion has become more feminine in style and\n              color and women are now wearing three-piece suits, ties and hats, and traditionally\n              men’s shoes. These distinctions may be relative and vary from society to society. For\n              example, in Scotland men traditionally wear little knee-length dresses called “kilts”.\n              In Scotland it would not be considered an imitation of females, but in a society where\n              only women wear such a dress it would be considered imitation.\n            </p>\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      ",subtitle1:"Hazrat Lut (AS)",key2:'\n      <p>\n      In the Quran, the people of Prophet Lut (PBUH) have been discussed often.

He used\n        the analogy that if a clock were discovered by someone and asked where it\n        came from, it would be absurd to argue that the clock was found simply\n        because it had existed forever. The clock exists because it has a maker who\n        made it for a distinct purpose. In this case, the clock has several intricate parts\n        that are put together, framed, and adjusted to produce motion, which in\n        turn is regulated to provide relative measure of time. Similarly he claimed\n        that the universe and its many parts, which are far more complex than a clock\n        must have intelligent design and purpose. As a simple example, anyone who\n        has studied the human eye would be foolish to think that it has been created\n        (or “evolved” as some would have it) without purpose or intelligent design.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n        Other kinds of design arguments relate to order, regularity and an\n        underlying unity in nature, have received increasing support in modern\n        scientific fields such as quantum physics, astronomy and biochemistry. An\n        emerging group of scientists has recently argued for the existence of God\n        from this angle.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n        For instance, scientists are continually affirming that the universe is a very\n        finely tuned system with 2 delicately balanced harmony of fundamental\n        constants or cosmic singularities. These constants are numerical values\n        assigned to various processes in nature such as gravity, the rate of expansion\n        of the universe, and nuclear forces. With respect to the formation of the\n        universe, astronomers have estimated that the balance of matter to\n        antimatter had to be accurate to one part in ten billion for the universe to\n        even arise. Had it been larger or greater by one part in ten billion, no universe\n        would have arisen. Similarly, the universe wouldn’t have arisen if the rate of\n        expansion of the Big Bang had been one billionth of a percent larger or\n        smaller.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n        Hoyle and Wickramasinghe have calculated the probability of the\n        random formation of a single enzyme feom amino acid anywhere on the\n        earth’s surface as being one in 1020. To complicate matters further, human\n        beings have around 2000 enzymes, which makes the chance of obtaining\n        them all randomly only one in 1,040,000. If that wasn\'t enough, you must\n        consider that enzyme formation is only one step necessary for life and says\n        nothing of the more complex processes like the formation of DNA, the\n        transcription of DNA to RNA or mitosis and meiosis, etc. In the end, they\n        conclude that the probability of life resulting from random ordering of\n        organic molecules is in effect <b>zero</b>.\n        </li>\n      ',subtitle1:"Counter Arguments...",key2:'\n      Despite the strength of these arguments, a number of criticisms of the\n      arguments from design have been made, the most prominent of which came\n      from <a target="_blank" class="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immanuel_Kant">Immanuel Kant</a> (1724-1804) and <a target="_blank" class="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume">David Hume</a> (1711-1776), and claim,\n      among other things, that:\n\n      <ol>\n        <li>the design or order we perceive is actully "mind-imposed” rather than “God-imposed",</li>\n        <li>\n        It is an unacceptable extrapolation to go from saying there is order in the universe to saying that God exists,\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        If there is order, then why can’t it be attributable to human beings or\n        mere chance?\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        If we ae consistent with the idea of order and design, then something\n        must have designed God,\n        </li>\n        <li>\n        unexplainable disorder and evil also exists.\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n      ',subtitle2:"And Responses...",key3:'\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n          If the order were purely “mind-imposed” and not “God-imposed” then\n          the whole system of scientific and empirical inquiry should be considered\n          “mind-imposed” and lacking any objectivity. While it is recognized that\n          there are limitations and subjectivity associated with modern scientific\n          methods, this does not mean that there are absolutely no objective\n          learnings to be had. The many mathematical equations that describe\n          various processes in nature are not mere figments of imagination and have\n          been proven to be excellent approximators of reality. If order were\n          mindimposed, does this mean that there was really no order when human\n          beings were not present on earth or that all semblance of order would\n          suddenly vanish if the human race were to be wiped out?\n          </li>\n          <li>\n          If it is acknowledged that there is some order that is imposed by\n          something other than the universe, then it is reasonable to suppose that\n          this being is powerful, purposive, incorporeal, immaterial, and has will.\n          Though this is an incomplete description of God, these qualities are,\n          nonetheless, important attributes of God.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n          The Cause of all causes, including order and design, must be other than this\n          world, otherwise it too will be like matter and subject to the law of\n          causation. In addition, the likelihood of the universe arising by mere\n          chance is essentially zero as indicated by modern calculations discussed\n          earlier.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n          If it is implied that Darwinian evolution or natural selection can be\n          used as an alternative to Divine order, then this too is blatantly false. Other\n          writers, such as <a target="_blank" class="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Behe">M. Behe</a>, <a target="_blank" class="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Dewar">D. Dewar</a> and <a target="_blank" class="is-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_C._Meyer">Stephen Meyer"</a> have offered a\n          thorough discussion of the fallacies in interpreting Darwinian evolution.\n          Suffice it to say, however, that even if one were to accept Darwinian\n          evolution, this does not in any way explain the cause or source of such\n          evolution. Darwin, himself expressed some of his doubts when he wrote a letter that "the belief in natural selection must at present be grounded entirely on general considerations... when we descend to details... we can\'t prove that a single species has changed, nor can we prove that the supposed changes are beneficial, which is the groundwork of the theory. \n          </li>\n          <li>\n          God cannot be caused or designed by another being. If the\n          implication of the original criticism is that multiple gods could also be\n          responsible for design, then there is no logic in such a thought. Multiplicity\n          only applies to finite beings. For example, if the world we occupy is finite\n          in space, multiple worlds can easily be envisioned; but if the world is\n          infinite in space there cannot be but one world. <br />\n          Similarly, there can only be one Infinite, Supreme Being- anything more would contradict the\n          concept of infinity. It is also worthwhile to reference the famous principle\n          known as “Occam\'s Razor’, which has even been defended by Hume\n          himself. This principle, which has been supported by numerous\n          philosophers and scientists, whether theistic or atheistic, states that\n          "entities are not to be multiplied beyond necessity". The implication is that\n          if a single, supreme God can be said to be responsible for intelligent design\n          in the universe, then there is no reason to posit multiple gods just for the\n          sake of argument. Still further, there is the problem of potential conflict\n          and division of power among multiple deities that must be dealt with.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n          Even if one were to accept the idea of disorder, one has to explain the\n          order that does exist. Nonetheless, to address the criticism, it should be\n          realized that disorder is also a subjective term that can be misperceived.\n          The modern study of fractals in mathematics is a clear example of order\n          being found where others had only perceived random disorder and ir-\n          regularity. Many patterns in nature, including everything from the branches of a tree, the winding path of a river or coastline, the distribution of galaxy clusters, the branching of blood vessels to even the Brownian motion of molecules and particles have been described by the concept of fractals that are generated by geometric equations that repeat at very small scales to produce amazing shapes and surfaces on a larger scale. Hence, just because Hume or Kant does not percieve order doesn\'t mean order doesn\'t exist.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      '},FirstCause:{title:"The Cosmological First Cause Argument",key1:"\n      <p>\n        One of the earliest thinkers to promote this argument was the famous Greek\n        philosopher, Aristotle (384-322 B.C.). It was later supported and modified by\n        Thomas Aquinas and countless other thinkers, philosophers and laymen\n        alike. Most theists and believers support this argument, though many clarify\n        that God is continuously sustaining the universe, not just initiating it. Others\n        support the argument of emanation. \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Aristotle related God as the “Unmoved\n        Mover” or “Prime Mover” who causes all causes and activity in the universe\n        since everything and every occurrence must be traced back to an original\n        cause or source based on the law of causality. God is the eternal Prime Mover\n        who moves all things while He remains stationary.

However, the Prime Mover or Cause of all causes is different from\n        secondary causes in that it is immaterial and spiritual in nature, and hence, is\n        not subject to the laws governing matter. In addition, the Prime Mover is an\n        agent that must be free to do as He pleases since this is the only way that a\n        temporal universe could arise from an eternal cause. He is also considered\n        infinitely powerful in order to create something out of nothing. Some have\n        also specified that the First Cause must be timeless and unchanging since if\n        there is no actual change, there is no change in time (others do not consider this an essential part of the argument). Time can only pass in connection\n        with movement or change and is also a creation of God.\n      </li>\n\n      <li>\n        David Hume has taken issue with the law of causality saying that the ideas\n        of cause and effect are distinct, and that it is possible for something to arise\n        without a cause. In fact, he argues that there need not be any explanation\n        whatsoever for the universe- it simply is the way it is.\n      </li>\n\n      <li>\n        Hume basically says that because we can imagine a being of existence without any cause, then it\n        follows that a being can exist without any cause or at least it must be proven\n        that a being cannot exist without cause. However, this argument is very weak\n        and has been refuted by a number of philosophers who argue that the mere\n        imagining of a being does not entail existence without cause. Imagining that\n        a chicken came into being without cause does not mean that the chicken can\n        actually exist without cause.

The\n          Kalam argument basically states that our current existence and universe has\n          to be finite and with a beginning because it would be impossible to arrive at\n          the present moment if the past were infinite and uncreated. It argues that it\n          is impossible to cross an actual infinite. Simply stated, no one can ever count\n          to infinity, so we cannot be living in an eternal universe. It should also be\n          remembered that the conditions which apply to the First Cause argument\n          also apply here - namely that the First Cause is immaterial, free, and timeless.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          The crux of the argument hinges on whether or not there can be an\n          infinite set of actual things or persons or events.

Without getting into the mathematical\n          minutiae of the debate, it is obvious that arriving at the present moment\n          involves more than just the issue of counting from zero to infinity, it also\n          requires a start or an impetus. This is analogous to trying to jump out of a\n          bottomless pit.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Some have claimed that modern science, particularly the Second Law of\n          Thermodynamics and the Big Bang theory, supports the idea of a beginning\n          to the universe. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that in a closed\n          system the amount of energy to do work is always decreasing, which when\n          applied to the universe as a whole, means it is constantly being expended and\n          will eventually cease to exist. This implies that the universe cannot be infinite,\n          otherwise it would have already reached an equilibrium end state. The Big\n          Bang theory developed in the 20th century basically states that everything,\n          including matter, energy, space and time, were all compacted into a single\n          point with no dimensions which exploded to form the universe. Regardless\n          of whether one believes in this theory or not, the theistic implication is that\n          the universe arose from what has been described as nothingness.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Others, like Stephen Hawking, have considered the possibility that. the\n          universe is neither finite nor infinite and could, instead, be finite but\n          unbounded in time. This theory is supposedly based on quantum\n          mechanics and Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Nonetheless, accepting\n          or rejecting this theory in our view does not undermine the theistic stance.\n        </li>\n\n        <li>\n          Some skeptics object that showing that the universe had a beginning\n          doesn’t actually prove the existence of God or the continuance of the\n          universe. It is, however, an important step in pointing to God’s attribute as\n          Creator, as well as having implications for Divine purpose and Necessary\n          Being, as we will discuss later.

It starts with the pre\n          mise that everyone and everything is dependent on someone ot something\n          else. Restated, everything in the world is contingent, and by inference, the\n          world itself is contingent. If one were to continue this series of contingency\n          and causality as far back as we can go, we still have an infinite contingent\n          series.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          Thus, to reach the present moment and for us to exist today, there\n          must be a non-dependent necessary being. In other words, there must be a\n          sufficient reason for the world which is other than the world. In this sense, this\n          argument is similar to the earlier First Cause argument. At the same time, it\n          is distinct because it argues that the essence of The Necessary Being must\n          inherently include existence, which bears some similarity to the ontological\n          argument of Anselm as we will see below. Hence, this argument not only says\n          that God exists, but that God must exist to solve this dilemma of contingency.\n          Unlike the Kalam argument, it posits God’s existence without needing to\n          debate the question of an infinite or finite universe.\n        </p>\n      ',subtitle1:"Objections...",key2:'\n      <p>\n        Of course, critics question the necessity of a “necessary being” and\n        question how we know that everything is contingent.

It is one of the\n          most clever examples of philosophical logic ever produced and has many\n          ardent supporters to this day. It starts with the argument that anyone, even a\n          “fool”, can believe that something exists, at least in understanding, for which\n          nothing greater or more perfect can be conceived. The second part of the\n          argument is that something for which nothing greater can be conceived cannot\n          exist in understanding alone, for existence in reality is greater than relative\n          existence in the mind, and that something is none other than God.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n        This elusive but clever argument had its detractors as one might expect\n        and some of their objections were as follows\n        </p>\n\n        <ol>\n          <li>\n            It is impossible to conceive of a “being than which nothing greater can\n            be conceived” since it would boggle the mind to think of something\n            infinitely perfect.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            If the argument were valid, then the mere imagination of an object, such\n            as a perfect island, would entail its actual existence.\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            Just because God is being defined as something that must exist does not\n            mean that the concept of God is real.

Secondly,\n          there is nothing in the definition of objects (or islands) that necessarily\n          entails perfection, whereas the definition of God entails perfection. Yes, it is\n          true that somebody could imagine a perfect island and this would not entail\n          its existence.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          However, there is no such thing as a truly perfect island because\n          I could always argue that there could always be more coconuts or trees or\n          parrots or levels of perfection ad infinitum. God, on the other hand, is\n          defined by His perfection of attributes and the Is nothing or no one more\n          perfect than He. Thus, since it is more perfect to exist than not, God must,\n          exist.\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n          As for the third objection, many critics incorrectly assume that Anselm is\n          merely defining God to include existence. What he is really questioning is\n          whether something for which nothing greater can be conceived can exist only\n          in our understanding or intellect. Others like Norman Malcolm have\n          interpreted Anselm’s statements in his “3rd Proslogion” as not assuming\n          existence as a perfection but instead, arguing that God must exist because He\n          is Necessary Being”. In other words, God exists not because existence is a\n          perfection, but because His existence is necessary (the Necessary Being\n          Argument).\n        </p>\n      "},Moral:{title:"Moral Argument",key1:"\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            Though it is uncommon to use morality as a primary basis in arguing for the\n            existence of God, it is nonetheless a popular line of thought that morality\n            requires God who is an objective source of moral and ethical commands\n            and possesses the power to enforce these commands by rewarding and\n            punishing act, thereby allowing justice to prevail inthe end. Immanuel Kant\n            however, used the goals of morality to argue for the existence of God. In his\n            view, other rational arguments, such as the ontological and cosmological\n            ones, cannot provide sound proof for the existence of God. He asserts that\n            the aim of morality is what he calls the “Highest Good” and ultimately,\n            hhappiness for self and society.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            In other words, perfect virtue must be\n            rewarded with perfect happiness. The catch, however is that human beings\n            cannot perfectly achieve this Highest Good or virtue in this world, nor is\n            there proportional reward of happiness for virtuous persons. Hence, there is\n            a dilemma with a Highest Good that seems unattainable, but is, nonetheless,\n            necessary end result of morality. To resolve the dilemma, he argues that God\n            must exist in order to reward fidelity to moral commandments and fully\n            realize the Highest Good. Hence, without God the Highest Good cannot be\n            realized.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            Critics of Kant deny that there must be a correlation between morality\n            and happiness and argue that someone may, hence, desite to be virtuous only\n            for the sake of happiness rather than for its own sake. They also use Kant’s own claim that rational arguments are futile in trying to prove God's\n            existence to say that the moral argument is simply another kind of rational\n            argument. However, what Kant claimed was that one bas the right to believe\n            in God, not as a metaphysical or rational tuth, but as a practical and moral\n            necessity. Another criticism surrounds the question of why we should believe\n            inthe ultimate prevalence of justice, for Kant seemingly infers the existence\n            ‘of God fiom what would happen if God existed.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            Other kinds of moral arguments assert that one can infer the existence of\n            God from moral commands. These commands imply the existence of a moral\n            commander of law-giver since each command should have a commander.\n            Others point to the moral conscience or sense of responsibilty and guilt that\n            people often naturally feel with respect to moral duties.\n          </li>\n\n          <li>\n            John Henry Newmans (1801-1890) wrote, “If as is the case, we feel responsibility, are ashamed, are\n            frightened, at transgressing the voice of conscience, this implies that there is.\n            One to whom we are responsible, before whom we are ashamed, whose claim\n            upon us we fear”. Atheists are quick to claim that moral conscience ean be\n            authoritative in itself and does not require answering to a Higher Being.\n            Correspondingly, they claim that moral conscience is merely an outgrowth of\n            Parental, societal and institutional influences instead of a Divine gift.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      "}}},M={Marriage:{},Quran:{},Voilence:{IslamSword:{title:"انتشر السيف الإسلام؟",key1:"كان للإسلام نوعان من الانتشار ، إقليمي وديني. المسلمون استولوا على الأرض بالقوة! كانت هناك مواجهات عسكرية بين الدولة الإسلامية والقوى العالمية الموجودة في روما وبلاد فارس. الإمبراطورية بطبيعتها تحاول التوسع طوال الوقت.",key2:"كانت الإمبراطورية البيزنطية تحاول التوسع ، كانت الإمبراطورية الساسانية تحاول التوسع. فقط 100 سنة مضت ، كانت الإمبراطورية الاستعمارية تفعل الشيء نفسه. حتى اليوم ، أمريكا تفعل الشيء نفسه ، فقط تم تغيير تعريف التوسع. لذا ، كان على الإمبراطورية المسلمة في ذلك الوقت أن تتوسع ، إذا لم تتوسع ، لكانت قد غمرت في إمبراطوريات أخرى.",subtitle1:"بعض التاريخ",key3:"كتب المؤرخون مثل كارول هيلينبراند أن المسلمين الأوائل لم يكن لديهم أسلحة خاصة لغزو البيزنطيين أو الفرس في وقت واحد ، أكبر الجيوش الدائمة على هذا الكوكب. أحد أسباب تقدم المؤرخين لهذا التوسع السريع للإمبراطورية العربية هو أن الجماهير ، الناس على الأرض دعموا التوسع ، رحبوا بهم كمحررين.",key4:"حدث هذا في سوريا ومصر وبلاد فارس وشمال أفريقيا وإسبانيا. عندما وصل طارق بن زياد إلى الأراضي الإسبانية ، تقدم الشعب اليهودي للترحيب بهم كمحررين.",key5:"بحسب برناند لويس ، مؤرخ يهودي ، عاش الشعب اليهودي تحت حماية الإسلام لأكثر من 1000 عام. كان العصر الذهبي اليهودي في إسبانيا ، الأندلس. كانت أقدم أكاديمية يهودية في بغداد. وبالمثل ، عندما تم طرد اليهود من إنجلترا من قبل إدوارد الأول ، ذهبوا إلى إسبانيا ، وبعد ذلك ، عندما طردهم فرديناند وإيزابيلا ، ذهبوا إلى العثمانيين.",subtitle2:"التحويل الإجباري",key6:"كما ذكر سابقاً في قضية الردة ، فإن التحويل القسري محظور في الإسلام. حكم المسلمون مصر وفلسطين ولبنان من القرن الثامن واستمرت الجماعات المسيحية الكبيرة في الوجود على مدى القرون الـ 13 الماضية. حكم المسلمون إسبانيا لمدة 700 عام والهند لمدة 1000 عام دون تحول الغالبية العظمى من السكان إلى الإسلام",subtitle3:"القرن الحادي والعشرين",key7:"كبر دولة إسلامية في العالم اليوم هي إندونيسيا ، التي لديها أكثر من 200 مليون مواطن ، ولم تر قط جنديًا مسلمًا. انتشر الإسلام هناك وفي ماليزيا والفلبين عن طريق التجارة. كان هذا هو حال انتشار الإسلام في دول غرب إفريقيا مثل نيجيريا وغانا والسنغال وتشاد والنيجر.",key8:"من أجبر الأتراك؟ من أجبر المغول؟ من الذي أجبر العلماء وعلماء الرياضيات مثل الدكتور موريس بوكايل ، والدكتور جيفري لانج ، والدكتور أتسوشي أوكادا ، والدكتور غاري ميللر؟ من الذي أجبر شخصيات مثل محمد علي ومايك تايسون ومالكولم إكس وسوني بيل ويليامز على سبيل المثال لا الحصر؟ الإسلام مسألة قلوب. وحتى لو كان هناك من أُجبر على قبول الإسلام ، كان ذلك خطأً تامًا."}},Core:{}},H={"en-us":q,ar:M};o["a"].use(x["a"]);const P=new x["a"]({locale:"en-us",fallbackLocale:"en-us",messages:H});var S=({app:e})=>{e.i18n=P};const Q="/";function B(){return W.apply(this,arguments)}function W(){return W=i()((function*(){const{app:e,router:t}=yield I();let a=!1;const n=e=>{a=!0;const n=Object(e)===e?t.resolve(e).route.fullPath:e;window.location.href=n},i=window.location.href.replace(window.location.origin,""),s=[S];for(let h=0;!1===a&&h<s.length;h++)if("function"===typeof s[h])try{yield s[h]({app:e,router:t,Vue:o["a"],ssrContext:null,redirect:n,urlPath:i,publicPath:Q})}catch(r){return r&&r.url?void(window.location.href=r.url):void console.error("[Quasar] boot error:",r)}!0!==a&&new o["a"](e)})),W.apply(this,arguments)}B()},"5b0d":function(e,t,a){}});
